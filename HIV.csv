"Jan 12, 2010, 04:39 IST","Dumped by husband, HIV+ woman seeks CM’s help","
  LUCKNOW: After running from the pillar to post for an year with no positive response from any of the government and non-government organisations (NGOs), 19-year-old Poonam (name changed) as a last resort has written an open letter to the chief minister Mayawati for help. The hapless woman was thrown out by her husband after she had tested HIV+ during delivery of her baby last year. Although she got the infection from her husband but the latter refuses to keep her saying that he has no money to bear the cost of treatment. He has also kept the baby with him.
  
  ,“I knocked at every door possible, be it NGOs or government organisations but only got sympathies,” said Poonam while narrating how her husband snatched her four-month-old daughter from her and threw her out of the house. “With no money and means of livelihood, I first went to my parents but my father was also not ready to accept me. My mother, however, intervened and helped me in approaching various government agencies and NGOs for help. However, at all the places people only made promises but none helped,” she rued. Poonam only want a job so that she can be financially independent and can claim custody of her daughter.
  ,
  ,In her letter, Poonam has described how hundreds of HIV+ women like her who want to stand on their feet and fight stigma but are being pushed back by government agencies and NGOs who thrive on grants procured in the name of HIV/AIDS awareness and welfare. “I hope being a women chief minister will help me out,” said Poonam who signed the letter “one of your daughter”. A dejected Poonam has also said that she would be forced to commit suicide, if no help came from the chief minister. “ What option do I have...should I take to prostitution and infect others...or beg on streets... better to end life,” she said.
  ,
  ,Poonam was just 16 when she was married to one Rajesh, who works as salesman in a small firm. The marriage does not have a legal sanctity because she was minor at that time. She has studied till class XI, which is also not enough to get a job. “ I understand the limitations but I am only asking for a job, may be a peon or a counsellor at any AIDS awareness centre or any task which may earn enough to take care of myself,” she said. At present, she survives on little money her mother sends every month. During the day, she wanders on the streets looking for work and in the night finds shelter in railways and bus stations.
  ,The woman also knocked the door of the State Women Commission and State Aids Control Society as well as other NGOs working for , positive people but got only assurances. The episode has also exposed the poor state of affairs in government set up for providing relief and rehabilitation to abandoned HIV+ women and children. There are over 1000 NGOs, funded by the government and other national international organisations, working in the field of HIV/AIDS in UP but none have any shelter home, barring ‘Shanti Niketan’ run by the ‘Sisters of Saint Joseph’, a Christian missionary organisation, but it has limited capacity.
  ,
  ,The state has over 1.4 lakh HIV+ people, of which nearly 30% are widows who acquired infection from their husbands but after their death were disowned by in-laws. Many like Poonam are denied shelter by their parents as well. Some also have children. The only option for them is to lead a traumatised life and die in oblivion. Officers claim that government gives enough funds to the NGOs for the job. The Lucknow Network for People living with HIV and AIDS has been helping such widows but resources are limited. Members complain that NGOs take grants in the name of HIV/AIDS but have done more harm to victims than infection.

"Jan 11, 2010, 03:16 IST",Researchers hopeful of finding HIV cure ,"
  CHENNAI: Researchers working towards a cure for , have hit upon possibilities with true potential to transform into viable solutions in the future, said ,, head, division of infectious diseases, University of California, San Diego. 
  With his previous experience as chair of the AIDS Clinical Trials Group, reputedly among the most productive multinational research organizations working on HIV pathogenesis and therapy, Schooley was an important contributor to the two-day ART Symposium in the city organized by YRG Care over the weekend to discuss cutting-edge technology in the field. 
  ,
  ,Speaking to TOI on Sunday about new scientific advances in the field, Schooley said, ""There are a host of approaches being adopted by researchers worldwide to try and eradicate HIV however the approaches using either enzymes or RNA to remove infected cells are ultimately the most hopeful and will be the least disruptive for the patient. Paula Cannon, a researcher from California, for instance, has been working on ways to identify HIV-infected cells called CD4 cells (so called because they have a molecule on the surface called CD4) which is a gateway for the virus. These cells have a second molecule called CCR5 which is a second door that the virus has to pass through. Now, she has created a way for the second molecule to be changed so that they virus cannot recognize it. In this approach, the virus stays outside the cell."" Elaborating on Cannon's research, he said she had been able to demonstrate it successfully in mice. 
  ,
  ,""The next step will be to take people with HIV infection who have lymphoma and so, would need a bone marrow transplant for their tumours. She would treat the stem cells and hopefully the bone marrow so grafted would afford the patients' cells protection from HIV,"" Schooley said. Pointing out that this was an experiment that had to be done, he cited the example of a similar case but with a natural modification of the CCR5 molecule being reported in the New York Journal of Medicine about 18 months ago. ""After the HIV-infected individual underwent a bone marrow transplant from such a donor, no one could demonstrate the presence of HIV in the patient. So, there is certainly some preliminary support for her research,"" he said. 
  ,
  ,Commenting on India's research potential, Schooley said that biotechnology was growing at an excellent pace in the country. ""There is some state of the art research work being carried out by YRG Care and some fantastically sophisticated research at National Aids Research Institute, Pune. In fact, the component sites that we have in Chennai and Pune are among the most productive. We are carrying out trials on the best drugs to use for HIV infections, treating people with drug failure and drug resistance and treating people suffering from HIV and Tuberculosis at the same time. There is a lot of important work being carried out over here. India is one of the best places for research activity worldwide,"" he added.

  BANGALORE: Nutrition, education and property rights. That's what children who are , demand from society. Better access to medical treatment and easy access to nutrition and continuation of education are among their primary demands.
  
  ,After a public hearing on `Child rights -- issues and entitlements of the orphan and vulnerable children affected/infected by HIV/ AIDS', Shantha Sinha, chairperson, National Commission for Protection of , (NCPCR), said four things topped their list of demands. ""A comprehensive nutrition programme is needed. Continuation of education is a problem for most because of social stigma,"" she said.
  ,
  ,The question of property rights is another bane for these children because many are thrown out of their homes with even siblings distancing themselves. ""This is fracturing families. Also, in several cases, there are no parents and children have to take care of the family. There are no rules on these cases ought to be handled,"" she added.
  ,
  ,The national commission is also mulling over a comprehensive child health policy and on conducting such public hearing at the district level. These have been held in Andhra Pradesh, Manipur and Tamil Nadu. A pilot hearing in Udupi, where the incidence of HIV/AIDS affected children is very high, is being considered.
  ,
  ,Both the national and state commissions were unanimous in saying the biggest problem was that there was no data on children affected by HIV/AIDS. However, it's estimated there are about 55,000 children orphaned due to AIDS or other reasons in just three districts of Belgaum, Bagalkot and Bellary.
  ,
  ,Guidelines not operational
  ,
  ,Though there are guidelines for children with HIV/AIDS, which have details on how to handle such cases, social workers say these are not yet operational on ground. Neither has the HIV Bill been passed.
  ,
  ,Nina P Naik, chairperson, Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, said there was no plan in the state for children affected with HIV/AIDS. If parents die, the ration card for the family is cancelled and they are not considered to be below the poverty line. ""HIV positive women with a son over 18 years no longer gets a widow pension. There is also a movement nationwide to include HIV positive people under the disability pension scheme,"" she added.
  ,
  ,It's been estimated that every 15 seconds a child loses a parent to AIDS and there are about 2 million children under 15 years who are living with HIV. According to a UNAIDS 2008 report, about 15 million orphans are AIDS orphans.

"Mar 7, 2010, 00:00 IST",HIV prevalence in city has dipped: AIDS body,"
  MUMBAI: The HIV/AIDS infection has seen a drastic decline among the general population of Mumbai, and new infections too have come down significantly. However, Mumbai's dream to be counted as one of the cities with lesser prevalence of HIV still remains a distant one.
  
  ,The city's AIDS control body, Mumbai District Aids , (MDACS), has collated figures for the last four years and concluded that the prevalence of the virus has come down from 10.65% in 2007 to 7.69% in 2010 (till May) among the general population. For pregnant women too, the decline has been from 0.91% to 0.58% during the same period. 
  ,
  ,Authorities attribute the decline to increased awareness among youth. ""It is the combined effect of awareness and our targeted interventions. Our biggest victory has been to prevent new infections,'' said project director of MDACS, Dr S S Kudalkar. The MDACS studied the data from 74 , and Testing Centres in the city. He added the percentage of HIV-positive pregnant women in the city used to be about 1.4 till four years ago, which has now come down to 0.5. ""Also, infection due to blood transfusions is down from 0.8% to about 0.4% in the same period,'' he said.
  ,
  ,The MDACS now hopes that the sentinel surveillance by the ,, which begins in October, will give a thumbs up to Mumbai's war against HIV.
  ,
  ,MDACS has realised that taking Mumbai from category A to category B for HIV prevalence remains a daunting task. Category A is defined as any district where the number of pregnant women testing positive at ante-natal clinics in high risk areas is over 1% in the last three years. For Mumbai to be counted as category B, the number of pregnant women testing positive at these centres should be less than 1%. ""Also, the city should have lesser number of hotspots like brothels,'' said a civic official.

  MUMBAI: Susheel Jha has had an unusual experience with the human immunodeficiency virus (,). A resident of the central suburbs, he proudly announces unlike many HIV-positive patients, he has never been bedridden by frequent bouts of illnesses.
  
  ,He credits his health to his family and hisemployer, the Indian Railways, who have been supportive ever since he was diagnosed with HIV while randomly donating blood at a donation camp way back in 1997.
  ,
  ,The unusual patient scaled another height three months back; he became the first HIV-positive person in Maharashtra to undergo a ,. In the stigma-ridden world of HIV/AIDS, 45-year-old Jha's story holds out hope for the two-million-plus Indians living with HIV.
  ,
  ,In Jha's case, his 64-year-old mother Sitara donated one of her kidneys to her first-born son. ""I just want to see my child living healthily next to me,"" she said over the phone from Benares.
  ,
  ,The transplant is a milestone of sorts. Not surprisingly then, Jha's nephrologist Dr M Bahadur, transplant surgeon Shailesh Raina and medical consultant Dr Om Srivasatava are ecstatic with his progress since the transplant was carried out at Jaslok Hospital last November 26.
  ,
  ,""This is the first time in Maharashtra that a HIV-positive person has got a transplant. It needs experienced specialists to manage the patient carefully so as to ensure that his body doesn't reject the donor organ while ensuring that the HIV infection doesn't flare up,"" Bahadur, who has been treating Jha since 2006, said.
  ,
  ,Admitting that it had indeed been a challenge to handle a HIV-positive patient, Srivastava said that the right medical environment (as in a super-speciality hospital like Jaslok), right protocol and medicines were needed for such transplants. ""If the HIV-positive patient's CD4 count is adequate and his viral load is negative, then he can safely undergo a transplant,"" added the Jaslok doctors.
  ,
  ,Worldwide, too, transplants for HIV-positive patients are a relatively new concept. In 2004, the US reported about a 100-odd liver and kidney transplants for HIV-positive patients.
  ,
  ,The man himself is calm. ""My HIV status was detected in 1997 and my kidney failure in 2006."" He was on dialysis for three years before doctors realised that transplant would be the only hope for him. ""In my 13 years with HIV, I took only 77 days of leave but I needed over three months of leave for the kidney transplant and the minor problems that cropped up after it,"" he said.
  ,
  ,Jha also believes that his employer, the Railways, played a great role in his ""healthy but HIV"" status. ""I have had access to antiretroviral drugs for the past 10 years. I was never discriminated against or passed up for promotion at my workplace. My dialysis would cost tens of thousands of rupees but the railways always paid up. They even paid for my transplant,"" added the father of two.
  ,
  ,Dr Harsh Jauhari, one of the seniormost nephrologists in the country, said that while a couple of HIV-positive patients had undergone transplants in India, little was chronicled about these special patients. ""There is a confidentially clause with HIV-positive patients that cannot be tampered with. So it is likely that we don't know about all the transplants that have taken place in this category. But there is no denying that these patients need specialised care,"" added the Delhi-based Jauhari.
  ,
  ,Another senior doctor said there were several issues about safety about the medical staff involved as well that had not allowed HIV-positive transplants so far.
  ,
  ,Incidentally, a study published in the Archives of Surgery last year by the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine said that HIV-positive kidney transplant recipients could have the same one-year survival rates for themselves and their donor organs as those without HIV, if certain risk factors for transplant failure were recognized and tightly managed.
  ,
  ,According to the report, ""HIV patients were earlier not considered transplant candidates as researchers thought that the survival rates after transplantation were greatly compromised by the disease, which cripples the body's immune system. Also, transplant patients take drugs that suppress their immune systems in order to prevent organ rejection, a regimen thought to further threaten their already fragile immune systems.""

  ,Many hospitals refused to treat me because I was carrying the deadly virus. No one even cared if I died. It was not my fault that I became HIV-positive. I was almost bedridden. Dr Shetty is like God to me. He has given me new life. All I want to say is that there is nothing to fear in life. Being HIV-positive is a different issue but other health problems need to be treated as well. Just have courage to fight... (he breaks down).

  ,HOW WAS IT DONE 
  ,During the six-hour open heart surgery, the body temperature is reduced to 18 degree (the normal temperature is 37 degree). The surgery is conducted in circulatory arrest, where the patient's body is frozen and entire blood collected to a reservoir. According to Dr Shetty the entire operation is conducted when the body is bloodless. Post-surgery the blood is pumped back into the body and the temperture is restored to 37 degrees.

  CHENNAI: While there has been an overall decline in the prevalence of , in ,, the prevalence of infection among men who have sex with men (MSM) are on the rise.
  
  ,This is demonstrated not only by the latest figures of the National Aids Control Organisation which show the prevalence in Tamil Nadu dropping from 0.5% in 2003 to 0.25% in 2007 in the case of general population and rising from 4% to 7% in the case of MSM but also by the findings of a survey conducted by Y R Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Research and Education (YRGCARE). The survey, comprising a sample of 721 MSM from 18 different cities in the state, found 9% of MSM to be HIV-infected.
  ,
  ,""The sustained campaign by the government about the use of condoms and its various awareness programmes for sex workers (the prevalence of HIV among them decreased from 9% in 2003 to 4.7% in 2007) and truck drivers have clearly shown results. But things remain unchanged as far as MSM and drug users are concerned,"" says Dr Sunil Suhas Solomon, senior medical officer and epidemiologist at YRGCARE, who presented the data at the 16th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Montreal last year.
  ,
  ,
  ,""MSM remain a hidden population in India primarily due to Section 377 of the IPC, which has historically criminalised sex between men, and also the societal and family pressures to marry. Hence, there is very little community-level data of HIV among MSM. So we used a technique called peer-driven recruitment, which uses MSM to recruit other MSM to arrive at the study sample,"" says Dr Solomon.
  ,
  ,The study also documented the existence of HIV epidemics among MSM in many smaller cities such as Tirunelveli, Ramanathapuram and Tuticorin, which are usually not included in the planning of interventions targeted at MSM. Also, more interesting was the finding that the prevalence of HIV and sexually transmitted infections among MSM who were married is double compared to MSM who were not married. 
  ,
  ,""About 35% of our sample of MSM were married. The higher prevalence of HIV infection among MSM who were married could partially be explained by their nature to keep their same sex practices even more hidden. Consequently, they ended up having more male partners, which has been shown by many studies to be a strong risk factor for HIV infection,"" explains Dr Solomon. 
  ,
  ,Sahodaran, an organisation that works with MSM, conducted a similary survey recently in association with the Tuberculosis Research Centre in Chetpet and found that 8% of MSM in Chennai were HIV infected. But Sunil Menon, who runs Sahodaran, says there is no tangible evidence to back such figures because the gay community still remains hidden. ""Maybe the figure is shown rising just because more people are testing now than they did before. So there is no way of saying whether the prevalence is increasing, decreasing or remains the same,"" says Menon.
  ,
  ,Says Dr Solomon, ""The current phase of the National AIDS Control Programme has initiatives targeting MSM. Only time will tell the effectiveness of these programmes but the government needs to be applauded for the fact that it recognizes HIV among MSM as an issue and is taking steps to address it. However, it is equally important to address issues related to the families (wives and children) of these marginalised populations who are also being placed at risk via their spouses' behaviors.""

"Mar 20, 2010, 05:54 IST","Sexual abuse, HIV haunt Kolkata streetchildren ","
  KOLKATA: An , explosion might be waiting to happen in Kolkata. One per cent of the city's 15,000 street children (in the age group of 5-14) are HIV-positive, but were not aware of the fact that they were carrying the deadly virus, reveals a survey conducted by the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED), Kolkata. 
  
  ,Most victims did not even know how the disease got transmitted or its symptoms and had contracted the lethal virus through sexual abuse, says the survey. While around 4% suffered from other sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis, nearly 10% of these youngsters faced , before turning 16. 
  ,
  ,Titled Non-tobacco Substance Use, Sexual Abuse, HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infection Among Street Children in Kolkata', the study was carried out across 58 municipal wards of the city. More than 550 street children, who have no family, were interviewed and observed from 2007 to 2009. Random blood samples were collected to check the prevalence of diseases like HIV, hepatitis B and sexually transmitted diseases. The results have left the team of researchers shocked. 
  ,
  ,""One per cent of these children were HIV-positive which is a big number. Being marginalised and without any access to medical care, they will probably never come to know of their HIV status. Or, by the time they do, they will have infected others. This is an alarming situation since the urban homeless often act as a bridge between the infected population and those who are at risk. We need immediate intervention to check a potential epidemic,"" said Kamalesh Sarkar, deputy director, division of epidemiology, NICED. Sarkar led a five-member research team for the study. 
  ,
  ,While no specific age of the HIV victims could be established from the random survey, all were below 16 years. Inquiring into the reasons behind the spread of the virus, the researchers found that most had faced sexual abuse. ""A minor percentage might have got the virus from sex workers. It is quite possible that they passed it on to others since both sexual abuse and promiscuity was common among street children. It is unlikely that any had got the virus from their parents,"" said Sarkar. 
  ,
  ,The study reveals that while 26% of male street children faced sexual abuse before they turned 15, 13% of the girls who faced abuse were above 15 years. Around 13% of the boys who visited sex workers suffered from sexually transmitted diseases. 
  ,
  ,""Without any shelter or protection, these children will continue to be vulnerable. Moreover, they had no idea of HIV or that they could end up carrying the virus and infect others. Since there has never been any such study in the past, it is difficult to say if the number is rising. But unless steps are taken, it will definitely spiral and pose a serious health hazard which we are probably not ready to deal with,"" said Baishali Bal, one of the researchers. 
  ,
  ,Less than half of the street children got two square meals a day, more than 85% slept in public places and earned less than Rs 1,000 a month. Substance abuse, the study disclosed, was extremely high among them. Thirty per cent used non-tobacco substances like adhesives, brown sugar, cocaine and alcohol. 
  ,
  ,NICED has proposed shelters and support centres for street children at railway stations. ""It is at places like stations and markets that they generally tend to camp in search of work and food. We have written to the railway ministry to join hands with us for shelters at the stations,"" said Sarkar.

  BAGALKOT: The state is in for a shock: the , of the , persons will be closed down on Wednesday. The Foundation had set up four hospitals across South India two years ago, to curb the spread of HIV in the region. They were established at Bagalkot (Karnataka), Guntur (Andhra Pradesh), Tiruchi (Kerala) and Kakinada (Tamil Nadu). 
  
  ,The US-based Global Foundation For AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM) had given financial support for the treatment of patients suffering from these three major diseases. A Chennai-based voluntary organization, Population of India, took help from the Foundation to set up these hospitals, which came as a boon to HIV-infected persons. 
  ,
  ,The Bagalkot hospital, which started out in a rented house in Godi, on Muchakhandi Road, served patients from North Karnataka. The hospital had a 50-bed capacity. More than 4,157 HIV-affected people have been treated in this hospital till today, but fatalities have been a mere 400. 
  ,
  ,The main reason for the hospital shutting down is that GFATM announced that it would discontinue funding. The agreement contract was not renewed from March 31, 2010. 
  ,
  ,The closure procedure began on March 15, with patients being shifted to the government hospital. Equipment worth Rs 30 lakh was returned to the parent organization. 
  ,
  ,It has also affected 32 staff working here, but it is patients who are worst hit. While the government is thinking of opening a separate section in the district hospital, it remains to be seen if these patients can be served round-the-clock and as efficiently.

  NEW YORK: In a breakthrough which may pave the way for a vaccine against AIDS, scientists have provided what they claim is the first-ever glimpse of the structure of a key protein, gp120, found on surface of a subgroup of HIV-1. 
  
  ,In addition, the scientists from California Institute of Technology demonstrated that a particular antibody to gp120 makes contact not only with the protein, but with CD4 receptor that gp120 uses to gain entrance into the body's T cells. 
  ,
  ,This three-dimensional understanding of how gp120 is built is more than just a basic scientific advance, they say. ""There's a tremendous continuing effort to develop a vaccine for , and most of those efforts use gp120. Having more structural information will facilitate better vaccine design,"" said lead scientist Ron Diskin. 
  ,
  ,The team looked specifically at gp120 from what is known as clade C HIV-1. To explain what that means, here's a brief HIV family history: Most people who get HIV and proceed to AIDS are infected with a member of the HIV-1 family of viruses. HIV-1 is divided into groups; most AIDS-related strains of the virus come from group M. The groups are further subdivided into what are known as clades. 
  ,
  ,Clade B is the form of group M HIV-1 most often found in the United States and western Europe, and the one that is probably best-studied to date. Clade C, the clade studied by the Caltech team, is ""the one that is devastating Africa and Asia,"" said Diskin. ""It's the one that probably causes the largest number of infections worldwide."" 
  ,
  ,In order to uncover the structure of clade C gp120--and determine if the hypothesis about its similarities was indeed true — the Caltech team needed to crystallize the protein. That was no easy task. Turns out, says Diskin, the protein itself is not stiff enough for crystallization. And so the researchers created a complex of molecules consisting of a gp120 monomer, a CD4 receptor, and an anti-HIV antibody known as 21c.

  PARIS: Lab work on mice has opened up a novel way of closing a gateway to the ,, according to a study published on Friday.
  
  ,The doorway in question is called ,, a protein that helps the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) penetrate a cell, its first step before hijacking the cellular machinery and reproducing itself.
  ,
  ,Around a decade ago, scientists discovered that people who had a tiny gap in the genetic code for making CCR5 were surprisingly resistant to HIV infection and took more time to progress to AIDS.
  ,
  ,This gene variant, known as CCR5 delta 32, results in smaller CCR5 proteins, which prevents most strains of HIV from infecting the cell.
  ,
  ,Testing a theory, scientists in the US took immature haematopoietic cells—which make immune and red blood cells—from mice. They modified some of the cells, using a brand-new enzyme “cutter” to delete the famous CCR delta 32 section.
  ,
  ,As a result, when these cells matured and divided, they lacked the key code for making normal CCR5.
  ,The modified cells were reinjected back into the rodents, which were then exposed to HIV. Twelve weeks after infection, the animals had recovered their stock of immune T-cells and their levels of HIV were very low.
  ,
  ,But “control” mice that had not received the modified cells were highly infected and their immune systems weak.
  ,If the approach is found to be safe and effective on humans, it opens the way to creating a long-term generation of HIV-resistant T-cells in the body—in other words, a patient could suppress HIV without taking powerful antiretroviral drugs.
  ,
  ,The experiment headed by Paula Cannon of the ,, Los Angeles, and reported in the journal Nature Biotechnology, is the third avenue that has opened up for CCR5 investigators. 
  ,Drugs that inhibit CCR5 are already being licensed as “salvage” therapy for patients whose immune systems have been crippled by HIV. Doctors are also testing in trials on volunteers a CCR delta 32 technique, but using T-cells as opposed to stem cells.
  ,
  ,“It’s a one-shot treatment if it works,” noted study co-author Paula Cannon, associate professor of molecular microbiology at the University of Southern California. In gene therapy, doctors try to coax the human body into doing something differently by tweaking its genetic structure. To treat HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, scientists have been experimenting with using gene therapy to boost the immune system.

"Jul 18, 2010, 19:58 IST",11 HIV cases detected among TB patients,"
  LUDHIANA: It seems that the , department's purpose of keeping track of , patients, facing a , risk, has been solved. As the department has started the concept of offering voluntary HIV testing and compulsory counselling to patients, 11 new HIV cases have been identified in the second quarter.
  
  ,Sources said in the second quarter, after a total of 800 TB patients, who never had undergone for HIV testing were checked, and 11 were found HIV positive. The integrated package had been started on April 1 where all the TB patients coming for the sputum tests were given the voluntary counselling on HIV and were motivated to go for the testing at the integrated counselling and testing centres. Till now, the district health department did not have the data regarding the number of TB patients suffering from HIV.
  ,
  ,While giving the information, one of the officials of the health department said that under this program counselling would be given at the integrated centre, and, if the TB patient agrees to go for the test and turns positive for HIV, then he/she will be given antiretroviral drugs free. At present, more than 500 TB patients are coming only in civil hospital for the sputum tests. 
  ,
  ,On the condition of anonymity, one of the staff members of the , Centre said that mostly people who were suffering from TB were at higher risk of getting the infection but due to the lack of awareness they did not come for the voluntary tests and patients themselves were not aware that they were suffering from HIV. 
  ,
  ,While giving the information, district TB officer Ashish Chawla said that this had been started with the aim to create awareness among the TB patients and to check the incidence among the TB patients as with this it was clear that almost 1% of the patients suffering from TB were suffering from HIV.
  ,
  ,Dr Chawla added that along with the status of HIV patients, it would be helpful to provide them treatment after checking the patients and would be helpful in deciding the follow-up treatment.

"Jul 21, 2010, 02:15 IST",Vaginal gel offers protection against HIV infection,"
  NEW DELHI: A vaginal , can now protect women against HIV , -- an innovation that scientists believe could be most crucial for reproductive health since the Pill.
  
  ,On Tuesday, scientists announced at the International , Conference in Vienna that they have successfully tested a gel, containing antiretroviral drug Tenofovir, which is usually taken as a tablet by , patients. The drug can reduce a woman's chances of contracting HIV from an infected partner by 50% if used 12 hours before and after having sex.
  ,
  ,Interestingly, the gel had undergone a safety and acceptability trial on 100 women at National Aids Research Institute (NARI) in Pune in 2007. It can also reduce the risk of genital herpes by 51%.
  ,
  ,Being hailed as a major breakthrough globally, the CAPRISA trial followed 900 HIV-negative, sexually active South African women in the age group between 18 and 40.
  ,
  ,Two-and-a-half-years on, researchers found the gel reduced chances of HIV infection by 50% after a year and 39% after 30 months. The study revealed that those women -- who used the drug consistently nearly 80% of the time before having sex -- would be 54% less prone to infection.
  ,
  ,Health secretary K Sujatha Rao told TOI ""This is a major breakthrough, and will especially benefit India's 300,000-strong sex worker community involved in multi-partner sex. It will also help women who usually do not have the power to insist on condom use and fidelity, or to abandon partnerships that put them at high risk.""
  ,
  ,K Chandramouli, director general of National Aids Control Organisation. added, ""At present, India has 2.7 million HIV patients. We also record 1.7 lakh fresh cases of HIV every year, nearly 40% of which are women. Such a microbicide, once ready for implementation in our programme, will greatly benefit women.""
  ,
  ,According to NARI director Dr R S Paranjape, the gel underwent safety and acceptability study in India as well. 
  ,
  ,""The preparatory work for the CAPRISA trial was conducted here along with the Microbicide Trials Network. The overall safety profile of the gel was good and it was well accepted by women. Presently, it provides 40% protection. The scientific community will now look at increasing this percentage,"" he explained.
  ,
  ,With a vaccine against HIV remaining elusive, scientists have for the past 20 years been looking for such an effective microbicide -- products such as gels, films, rings or creams that women could apply on their , to prevent HIV transmission.
  ,
  ,Finally, the breakthrough has happened, thanks to the microbicide that contains 1% Tenofovir.
  ,
  ,Tenofovir gel is an advanced second-generation HIV-specific microbicide that neither tries to kill the AIDS virus nor block it from entering the body as its predecessors. Instead, it is designed to prevent the virus from replicating when it comes in contact with an uninfected T-cell.
  ,
  ,Naturally, the virus will fail to survive for long to cause systemic infection.
  ,
  ,Women, who constitute 50% all new HIV cases globally, are also twice as likely as their male partners to contract HIV during unsafe sex. ""Tenofovir gel could fill an important HIV prevention gap by empowering women who are unable to successfully negotiate mutual faithfulness or condom use with their male partners,"" said study co- principal investigator Dr Quarraisha Abdool Karim. ""Eleven trials in the past 15 years have shown no change or even sometimes an increase in transmission rates. Tenofovir gel has a potential dual effect in preventing HIV. Since women with genital herpes are much more likely to become infected with HIV, the additional protection of tenofovir gel against herpes creates a second mechanism whereby the gel may have a bigger impact in preventing HIV,"" he explained.
  ,
  ,The gel is undergoing another Microbicide Trials Networks VOICE -- Vaginal and Oral Interventions to Control the Epidemic -- study that will provide evidence about the safety and efficacy of tenofovir gel used daily, irrespective of when participants have sex.
  ,
  ,Once this study is conducted, drug regulatory authorities will determine if the gel is safe and effective for HIV prevention. It may take another two years before public can use it.
  ,
  ,Michel Sidibe, executive director of UNAIDS, said, ""For the first time, we have seen results for a woman-initiated and controlled HIV prevention option.""

"Jul 20, 2010, 02:34 IST",48% spurt in number of HIV patients receiving life-saving ART,Asia's fight against AIDS
"Jul 19, 2010, 01:46 IST",New blood test helps identify HIV status of newborns,"
  NEW DELHI: A simple blood , is now helping India identify the status of children born to , positive mothers as early as six weeks after their birth, instead of 18 months.
  
  ,Till recently, paediatricians in India, on detection of anti-HIV antibodies in children below 18 months, could never tell for sure whether they were already infected or the antibodies were transferred to them from their mother.
  ,
  ,Therefore, doctors couldn't even start the life-saving Anti-Retroviral Treatment -- the only effective way to treat HIV -- on them. This, according to National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), led to 33,000 new infants getting the infection every year from their HIV positive mothers.
  ,
  ,India, in March, rolled out the highly accurate DNA PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test in the four high prevalence states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra.
  ,
  ,Available in 767 Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) and 180 ART centres, the DNA PCR can test the , sample of a child after it reaches six weeks of age and accurately say whether it is already infected with HIV or not.
  ,
  ,The antibody test available before March could only confirm the HIV status after the child reached 18 months of age.
  ,
  ,In the last three months, 45 children have been tested for HIV status. NACO hopes to roll out the test to 10,000 children born to HIV positive mothers by March next year.
  ,
  ,""As soon as the child of an HIV positive mother is older than six weeks, his or her blood sample is collected and transported to seven national labs for testing with DNA PCR which gives us a definitive diagnosis on the child's HIV status. The report is available in just a week,"" NACO's ART chief Dr B B Rewari told TOI before leaving for the International AIDS Conference in Vienna.
  ,
  ,Dr Rewari, who will present this data in Vienna, added, ""Usually, if such children aren't put on treatment, 50% of them die within the first year of birth if infected. So early diagnosis and treatment is vital.""
  ,
  ,Till now, India has detected 19,000 children with HIV.
  ,
  ,Unlike other tests, the HIV DNA PCR test does not rely on the presence of antigens or antibodies in the blood for diagnosis. Instead, it identifies genetic material by highlighting sequences of the virus within the subject's DNA.
  ,
  ,Experts say all babies born to mothers with HIV are born with HIV antibodies. Babies who are not infected lose their antibodies by the time they are about 18 months old. However, most babies can be diagnosed as either infected or uninfected by the time they are three months old by using DNA PCR test.
  ,
  ,""The PCR test is more sensitive than the HIV test, and is not used in the standard HIV testing of adults. It looks for the presence of HIV itself, not antibodies,"" a NACO official said.
  ,
  ,When a woman is tested HIV positive, she is offered special medical care to reduce the risk of her baby being infected. Some pregnant women with HIV decide to have their baby. Others choose to have a termination.
  ,
  ,""There are now very effective drugs that can reduce the risk of an HIV positive mother passing the virus to her baby in the womb or at birth. Delivery by elective Caesarean section also reduces the risk of a baby becoming infected. Beast-feeding in such cases increases the risk of the baby becoming infected,"" the official said.
  ,
  ,* An estimated 22.7 lakh Indians are infected with HIV
  ,
  ,* India has an HIV prevalence of 0.29%
  ,
  ,* It usually takes 10 years for HIV to become full blown AIDS
  ,
  ,* The first AIDS case in India was reported from Chennai, in 1986
  ,
  ,* Globally, more than 33 million people have AIDS or HIV, half of them women

  LUVKNOW: Even before the virus could affect their health, the HIV stigma has eclipsed their lives. Innocent children born to positive parents facing discrimination and insecurity fail to reason their agony. Over 40 such children have broken their silence. Using comics strip they have shared their feelings and urged for a humane treatment.
  
  ,Some of these comics strips would be displayed with the Red Ribbon Express (,) in August. The comics were prepared by them at a workshop organised by World Comics India. Supported by ,, the workshop was held at the Nehru Yuva Kendra and concluded on Wednesday.
  ,
  ,Suresh and Sita are only examples to show how children born to positive people are ostracised. At first glance, they appear like any ordinary siblings. But a little probe makes one realise that the world has really fallen apart for these HIV positive children.
  ,
  ,""At an age when what they need the most is decent living, these kids are fighting the deadly disease,'' said Ramesh Srivastava, a volunteer working for kids like the duo. Their parents were thrown out of their native village in east UP.
  ,
  ,Construction site owned by their Chandigarh-based maternal uncle became their home after the death of their parents. Kids were made to work like labourers in lieu of two meals a day. But when their aunt came to know about them being HIV positive, she drove them out.
  ,
  ,The kids, in an attempt to return to their roots, reached Lucknow and were seen by policemen near Itaunja. The cops sent them to an orphanage and informed protection home authorities who sent them to Shanti Niketan of Lucknow, one of the few places in the country which takes care of AIDS orphans. 
  ,
  ,Now 12, Suresh has been able to reason the treatment he got till he reached this home. However, he is not ready to feel `pitiable' on account of this virus he inherited from his parents. ""It's not my fault,'' he affirms and tells the same to his sister. His comic-strip also says the same.
  ,
  ,""This is the basic message that needs to be disseminated across the society to ensure a future for kids like Sita and Suresh. People sensitive to their plight can help in re-integrating them with the society by improving their living conditions and ensuring economic and social autonomy,'' said Augustine Veliath of Unicef.
  ,
  ,Besides producing a tool to sensitise people and create awareness, the kids had a great time. ""We began with learning to make faces using alphabets O and T. While O becomes the outline of the face, eyebrows, nose and mouth are sketched out of the T,'' said Mohit, who actively participated in the workshop.
  ,
  ,Sharad Sharma, founder World Comics India who taught the kids how to draw, added that with a little practice, children switch over from simple faces to the ones carrying expressions. ""The trainees were then taught to conceptualise a story based on an issue with a message, imagine characters, think of a catchy beginning and an end with an impact,'' he said.

  CHENNAI: After years of providing treatment, care and support for HIV/AIDS among high risk groups like truckers, commercial sex workers, injectable drug users and transgenders, the government is suddenly faced with a new challenge -- the increasing incidence of , among youth, possibly due to unsafe casual sex. Concerned by the trend, the Tamil Nadu State , Control Society (TNSACS) is organising a youth carnival to create awareness and promote safe sex.
  
  ,The state has been boasting about a decline of infection in the population, but those working in the HIV/AIDS sector fear that there is an increase in the incidence of the disease. A recent analysis undertaken by TNSACS has shown that the profiles of the newly infected people were not from the high risk groups. ""Instead they were housewives, single working people and students. We also did a study on usage of condoms among youth. That's when we found that many have occasional unprotected intercourse with multiple partners,"" said Dr. S.Thennarasu, the regional coordinator.
  ,
  ,Other senior officals in TNSAC confirmed the trend. ""The infection rate is high only within the age-group of 15-29 years. Today, casual sex has a fair amount of social acceptance. Mobility amidst both sexes is on the rise,"" the official added. 
  ,
  ,Others working in the sector agree. ""There is a clear decline in the HIV prevalence rates among sex workers and truckers. In a small study we found that casual sex among working professionals particularly those in garment industry and the BPO sector was high."" said Dr R Lakshmibai, the project director of TAI.
  ,
  ,As per data furnished by the TNSAC, the prevalence of HIV among commercial sex workers had decreased from 8.8% in 2003 to 3.6% in 2007. Consequently, even prevalence of other Sexually Transmitted Diseases(STD) had decreased from 16.8% in 2000 to 8% in 2007. However, the state registered a total of 28,000 cases in 2008-09 and 30,000 new cases in 2009-10.

  ,""There were only basic awareness programs conducted for the general population. Otherwise, we focused only on target groups. It's probably time to change that,"" said an official. TNSACS, in association with APAC and TAI will organise a youth carnival in August that will attempt to sensitise them to the dangers of unsafe sex with strangers. ""Intercourses with multiple partners is always risky,"" explained Dr Bimal Charles, project director of Aids Prevention and Control Project (APAC). ""And the youth are always prone to experimentation. If they are not aware of safety, it increases the risk.""

  ,A couple of days back, an inspection was conducted at Civil Hospital by NACO officials in the city. In the inspection, along with the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre, blood bank was checked. It was decided to start the oral substitution therapy for intravenous drug users (IDU).
  ,
  ,Under this programme, oral medicines would be given to all drug users to help them kick the habit. This would also help in reducing the risk of HIV transmission from one intravenous drug user to another. Needles are a predominant mode of spread of HIV. 
  ,
  ,And addicts often stop caring about sharing of needles, resulting in a higher risk of contracting HIV.

  ,A few weeks back, a study was conducted by an NGO Rising Youth, wherein it was revealed 75% truck drivers visit commercial sex workers and syringes are commonly used by them. What is more alarming is that only 10% of these drivers use precautions like contraceptives.

  Harjeet is no different from the thousands of Punjab villagers who dream of a well-paying job in the Gulf. In 1995, he applied for a work visa, forking out Rs 20,000 to an agent in Mumbai. A mandatory medical check followed and all the doctor would tell him was that ""something is wrong"" with his blood test results. He offered however to help suppress information for a ""commission"" of Rs 2,000. 
  
  ,The expenses cost Harjeet a loan but he managed to fly to Saudi Arabia. On arrival, he was subjected to another medical test. To his shock, he was soon after whisked away to an isolated cell and jailed there for a day. The next day he was taken to a court which ordered his deportation. Harjeet, it seems, had tested HIV-positive . 
  ,
  ,Back in India, Harjeet found that his wife had walked out of the family home with their two children. He was packed off to a care centre and left alone to deal with his situation. Severely depressed, Harjeet began getting multiple seizures that left him partially paralysed . He eventually recovered with a lot of support from the care centre. Today, Harjeet works with people who are HIV-positive and his life story has been documented by the , (IAS). 
  ,
  ,Harjeet is not alone. Thousands of people across the world have been deported or denied entry into countries because they are HIV-positive . This is despite the fact that stigmatising HIV-positive individuals is contrary to effective public health programming. 
  ,
  ,Official data shows that 66 countries, territories and areas deny entry, stay or residence to HIV-positive individuals: of these, 26 deport migrants who test positive, seven refuse permission to stay beyond a certain time bar and six deny entry even for very short-term stay. 
  ,
  ,""It is incomprehensible that HIV-related entry and residency restrictions still exist,"" says Kevin Moody, International Coordinator and CEO, Global Network of People Living with HIV. ""These restrictions are in blatant violation of human rights, they stimulate stigma and discrimination and actually hurt the response to the HIV epidemic."" 
  ,
  ,India's health secretary, K Sujatha Rao, believes that irrational discriminatory laws should be lifted. ""In India, we don't have any laws against residence or visit by HIV patient,"" she points out. 
  ,
  ,Many of these restrictions, says the IAS, were imposed in the early days of the epidemic, when there was a great deal of ignorance, fear and prejudice surrounding the subject. At that time, many governments saw these laws as an attempt to ""protect the public health"" and avoid the potential costs of care. 
  ,
  ,The situation has, however, changed dramatically. There is a lot of information available about the disease and its prevention and the antiretroviral treatment can extend the life span of those who are HIV positive. Dr Helene Gayle, chief advisor to US president Barack Obama on ,, points out that these restrictive laws are no longer justified by concerns about public health. 
  ,
  ,""Over 60 countries around the world have a variety of , that restrict the entry, stay or residence of people living with HIV including Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Qatar, Oman, Russia, Colombia , South Korea, Yemen and Armenia ,"" says Dr Gayle. According to IAS executive director Craig McClure, scientific evidence shows that travel restrictions against those who are HIV-infected make for ineffective prevention tools. ""These laws are not consistent with current scientific knowledge, best practices in public health and humanitarian principles. They sustain a culture of exclusion, rights violations and marginalisation that impedes an effective response to the epidemic,"" says McClure. 
  ,
  ,A WHO statement points out that such entry restrictions actually pressurise people into concealing their HIV infection from immigration authorities. They simply do not carry their HIV medicines on international trips. This could lead to drug-resistant HIV strains that are transmissible to other people. ""Furthermore, because drug resistance allows HIV to replicate in the body more freely, people with higher viral loads are also more infectious,"" says the statement. 
  ,

"Aug 13, 2010, 05:49 IST",'Ayurveda hope for HIV+ patients',"
  MUMBAI: With no cure in sight for the dreaded HIV, scientists across the globe are working towards drugs to prolong the life-span of afflicted patients. An ongoing study by the , to find out the efficacy of ayurvedic drugs in improving the life expectancy of , positive patients has yielded some positive results. 
  
  ,The medicine department of the hospital has been studying the potency of an ayurvedic drug on 700 HIV patients since April last year. After little more than a year, the institute found a significant boost in the count of CD4 cells in these patients, and also that it could probably push the initiation of anti-retroviral therapy (ART), known to have many side-effects, by a few years.
  ,
  ,The count of CD4 cells is directly proportional to the health of a person for these cells are the most important part of one's immune system. Anyone with less CD4 count is more prone to ailments as the body's defence mechanism starts giving way. The ART for HIV patients is started only after the CD4 count falls below 250. 
  ,
  ,After administering the ayurvedic drug, the doctors found that the CD4 count in patients on an average went up from 448 to 546 within six months and up to 590 in a year's time. Besides, many patients had weight gains, increase in haemoglobin count and a sense of well-being. 
  ,
  ,Claiming that it spells a lot of promise, head of medicine at KEM Hospital Dr A R Pazare said that not every patient who tests positive for HIV immediately qualifies for the ART drugs. ""Till a patient's CD4 count comes down to 250, we cannot prescribe ART. But patients show apprehension to go back home without medicines, especially after they are found positive for such a dreaded ailment,'' he said. Moreover, ART has side-effects like pain in abdomen, weakening of limbs and arms, swollen abdomen and distortion of facial features. 
  ,
  ,Therefore, Pazare believes that patients could be prescribed some ayurvedic drugs with immuno-restorative properties that can delay the initiation of ART. ""Our assumption is that ayurvedic drugs with properties to strengthen immunity can delay the ART therapy by at least four years,'' said Pazare. ""And later, as the patient is put on ART, he can survive for a few more decades,'' he added. The KEM hospital study will be on for the next five years. 
  ,
  ,However, the study solely focused on CD4 cells and did not check if the drug could bring down the viral load in a patient. Another hitch remains that ayurvedic drugs cannot be consumed simultaneously with the ART drugs. 
  ,
  ,Speaking on the use of alternative therapies, head of ART department of , said nations across the globe were looking for indigenous medicines for HIV. ""Even in India, more systematic studies are required as there is no standardised data that talks about long-term effects,'' she said. Yet, she added that it may not be a bad idea to put patients on ayurvedic medicines with proven benefits till they are ideal candidates for ART.

  WASHINGTON: Scientists claim to have found evidence that , in semen is different from HIV-1 in blood, possibly due to changes the virus undergoes in the male genital tract.
   
  ,To better understand the process by which HIV is transmitted, experts compared the gene encoding the major surface protein of HIV in semen and blood. ""In some men, the virus population in semen was similar to that in the blood, suggesting that virus was being imported from the blood into the genital tract and not being generated locally in the genital tract.

  ,""We found two mechanisms that significantly altered the virus population in the semen, showing that virus can grow in the seminal tract in two different ways,"" , of ,, who led the team, said.
  ,
  ,In one way, one or more viruses grow rapidly in the seminal tract over a short period such that the viral population in semen is homogeneous as compared to the population in the blood. In the other way, the virus replicates in T cells in the seminal tract over a long period, creating a separate population of virus in semen that is distinct from the blood virus.

So, even though it took her some time, this 28-year-old ,, who is HIV positive as is her six-year-old daughter, managed to convince the villagers of Longe, Kolhapur, that neither she nor her daughter are a threat to society. This August, the Longe gram panchayat ""respectfully requested her to return as an anganwadi worker and allowed her daughter to attend the village school.""
  
  ,The woman told TOI, ""I am relieved that I can live with dignity. This is an important win.""
  ,
  ,It all started in early 2009. Sanjeevani Kulkarni, founder-president of NGO Prayas, that works for the uplift and fair treatment of the HIV-affected, narrated the woman's story. ""Her husband was first detected with HIV in early 2009 at the village primary healthcare centre. She too underwent the test. Both the woman and her daughter tested positive, though her older son did not,"" she said. "" When the villagers came to know their status, they were not uncooperative. They helped the family in many ways.""
  ,
  ,Eventually, the woman's husband passed away in late 2009. Though she continued to be in good health several eyebrows were raised at the fact that she was an anganwadi sevika. ""Parents were worried that her proximity to their children would prove detrimental to their health and well-being and that her little daughter would pass on the infection to other children in the village school. Now these worries are neither scientific nor logical. Nevertheless, she was asked to stay home with the promise that her salary would be sent to her. Her daughter was denied admission to the school. When this state of existence was unacceptable to her, the woman left the village with her children,"" Kulkarni said.
  ,
  ,She went to Mumbai this June and got in touch with the media, as well as various NGOs that work for the HIV positive. Her voice was heard and gradually the wheels of hope began spinning once again, especially when tehsildar Vijaya Jadhav got to know of the situation.

  ,Though HIV is an increasingly thriving menace in our society, little thought is spared for children who suffer after their parents fall victim to it. For no fault of their's, they are left to face the extreme bitterness of living with the disease.
  ,
  ,With treatment options expanding, issues about their future get more complex. Sneha Care Home (SCH) stepped in to address these issues. Started on July 14, 2008, SCH and Shining Star School address multiple issues of children infected with HIV, as well as prepare them for a productive and constructive life. 
  ,
  ,""Now with treatment options increasing dramatically, the life span of HIV-infected has also gone up, making us think of their future too,"" says Fr Mathew Perumpil, director of Sneha Care Home.

  ,""When they grow up and become sexually active, they become potentially dangerous in transmitting the virus. Initially, we used to send our children to nearby schools. Once a teacher in the school noticed one of our boys growing intimate with a girl from his class and alerted us. We were totally unprepared to handle such a situation. That is when we started this new venture with 20 children where they are given value-based education,"" he adds. 
  ,
  ,Now SCH houses 83 children who are below 12 years of age, including 34 girls. Most of them were orphaned due to the deadly HIV and many are with single parent.

  ,Children are educated at the Shining Star School on their premises which ensures a good value system. The school, based on National Open School Curriculum, focuses on encouraging creativity and auditing the aptitude of these children. ""We want them to enter a good profession which is less physically taxing and that will define their self-esteem to live a life full of hope and meaning,"" says Perumpil.

  ,The tiny bundles of energy who run around here prove these points. With a smile on their lips and stars in their eyes, they are surging ahead in life. Ten-year-old Varalakshmi wants to become a nurse when she grows up. Ask her why: ""I want to take care of others,"" she quips.

  ,The incident came to light after the woman told about her plight to other patients of a nearby ward. The 25-year-old woman was admitted to KGH by a voluntary organisation on Aug 20 and she gave birth to a baby girl the very next day. While the baby is doing well, the doctors at the gynaecology ward stopped attending to the woman and the baby after coming to know about her HIV-positive status.
  ,
  ,Shockingly, the woman's husband, a daily wage worker, has also left her after learning that she was afflicted with the deadly virus. ""Neither have my parents nor in-laws come to see me. I don't want to live any more as no one is ready to help me and my child,"" she cried. She belongs to Palasa in Srikakulam district.
  ,A pregnant woman hailing from Bhimili, who is also HIV-positive, said the doctors and the staff were not attending to them. ""We do not know how we contracted the virus. But the doctors and the society continue to shun us for no fault of ours,"" she complained.
  ,
  ,When contacted, KGH superintendent Santaram said an enquiry has been ordered following complaints from HIV-positive patients. ""We are trying to make every medication available for them. The mother and the child would be discharged from the hospital soon as they are doing well,"" he claimed.
  ,
  ,Meanwhile, swine flu scare has gripped the pregnant women in KGH. With the authorities setting up an exclusive swine flu ward close to the gynaecology ward, all the pregnant women are worried about the welfare of their children.
  ,""How could they be so foolish to set up the swine flu ward next to the gynaecology ward? We are all worried,"" a woman, who is into her advanced stages of pregnancy, said. A six-bed swine flu ward has been set up and already two pregnant women of Vizianagaram suspected to be carrying the H1N1 virus were admitted there.
  ,
  ,Sources said nearly 50 mothers of new-born babies and pregnant women in the gynaecology ward have been living in fear ever since the swine flu ward came into being. However, the authorities of KGH said the special ward was established since the communicable diseases hospital where swine flu cases are being treated does not have full-fledged facilities to treat pregnant women infected with H1N1 virus.

  CHENNAI: Their future had appeared bleak. With no medical treatment or hope of life, , had little to look forward to. But more than two decades after the deadly disease was first detected in Chennai, several babies now have a chance of survival into adulthood thanks to medical regimen and better nutrition.
  
  ,When the Indian government began the national Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) for HIV patients in 2004, the programme was a godsend to many infected patients who had even given up on the idea of survival. ""Before the ART programme began, morbidity and mortality rate for HIV positive patients were high,"" says Dr P Manorama, chairperson of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), who runs a home for HIV positive children in Chennai. Today, mortality levels have significantly reduced, from 13 % in 2005 to 8 % in 2010, according to the , (TANSACS).
  ,
  ,But all the medical and financial aid given by the government is not enough to offset the need for emotional support for the patients, especially children infected with HIV. According to statistics furnished by TANSACS, there are 11,197 children living with HIV in the state today and a sizeable number among them are adolescents.
  ,
  ,Daisy David of World Vision, an NGO working with HIV positive teenagers, says there is a large segment of children born with the disease, who have today reached their adolescence. ""Children living with HIV have the same exposure to society and media as other children,"" she points out. ""They too grow up with ambitions and desires. However, the discussions provided by the government are inadequate. They not only need counseling on career ambitions and how to battle life on the professional front, but also on the changes their bodies undergo and their own desires regarding sex, marriage and companionship.""
  ,
  ,Counselling HIV teenagers about marriage and companionship is rather difficult. ""There is need for counsellors who are equipped to handle all kinds of issues and emotions,"" says Dr.Lakshmibai, project director for Tamil Nadu Aids Initiative (TAI). 
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,""Many of them would like to marry non-infected persons, so there is always the issue of acceptance and rejection,"" says Daisy, who had recently attended a workshop for HIV-infected adolescents in Manipur. ""At Manipur, I met a teenaged boy who was battling rejection after his girlfriend found out he was HIV positive. They all had questions as to whether they could have sexual intercourse with non-infected persons, whether the babies born out of such a bonding would also be infected. The very fact that they needed to ask these questions shows that they are not receiving this kind of information or counselling.""
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,The other issue that social workers stress on is a tailor-made counselling program for drug adherence. According to statistics furnished by the TNSAC, until June 2010, 3,298 people had not returned

"Sep 18, 2010, 22:58 IST",BHU ART centre helping HIV patients in a major way,"
  VARANASI: It is perhaps the most disturbing moment for a person when he comes to know that he is HIV positive. And, Varanasi is supposed to be one of the main centres of HIV infected persons due to its migrant population.
  
  ,""In Varanasi district alone, there are over 1,000 persons infected with HIV and the number of such people goes above 11,000 in eastern parts of UP,"" informed secretary, Banaras Network of Positive People Living with , (commonly known as BNP+), Sunil Seth. The network is spread over 30 districts of the state with active members to motivate and help HIV persons to lead a purposeful life.
  ,
  ,However, according to WHO report, over 34 million people are living with HIV and AIDS across the world. India alone, with 2.3 million cases of HIV, has the third highest number of HIV affected persons in the world. 
  ,
  ,According to the , (NACO), around 3,22,521 persons were taking treatment for AIDS by April 2010. And, to give a new lease of life to such persons, the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre at the , (BHU) is playing a remarkable role. ""So far, 11,321 HIV patients have been registered with the ART Centre, ,, BHU,"" said Dr Jaya of the centre. ""Around 4,500 patients are living on therapy and get regular medicines,"" she added. The ART at BHU is one of the 10 centres of excellence in HIV care in the country and the only in Uttar Pradesh, where the facility of second line drugs is available. It monitors the activity of 11 ART centres in Bihar, UP and Madhya Pradesh. It is also a training and research centre.
  ,
  ,According to the doctor, those patients registered in ART centre of BHU, who have completed six month's therapy and are stable and have increasing CD4 count, can be referred to Link ART centres affiliated to BHU ART centre established in the neighbouring districts of Ballia, Ghazipur, Jaunpur, Mau, Sonebhadra, Bhadohi, Chandauli and Azamgarh. They are basically drug distribution centres. Beside the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) and Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission (PPTCT) centre, Shiv Prasad Gupta District Hospital Kabirchoura, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Regional Hospital Pandeypur and Central Jail Hospital Sivpur are other centres where free HIV investigation is available under NACO supervision.
  ,
  ,The crux of the whole exercise is to protect precious human life. The doctor says if by mistake one deviates and acquires this disease, he should not lose courage. He should get investigated and should take proper medicine and advice from the health personnel. An early diagnosis of HIV status helps in preventing and significantly delaying morbid conditions associated with HIV/AIDS. If the HIV-infected person is irregular in time or quantity of the drugs, or he starts and stops the drugs abruptly, the treatment becomes ineffective. The HIV infected person can live a productive and healthy life if he takes care of his health, eating habits and lifestyle.
  ,
  ,Vital Facts
  ,
  ,What is HIV?
  ,
  ,Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a virus, which damages the body's immune system by destroying CD4+lymphocutes. This CD4 cells help us to fight against infections. Thus destruction of these cells by the virus leads to immune deficiency and susceptibility to different infections.
  ,
  ,How it spreads
  ,
  ,HIV infection spreads through unsafe sexual contact, transfusion of infected blood or blood products, sharing needles to inject drugs and from mother to child during childbirth and breast-feeding. However, HIV does not spread through mosquito bites, tear, saliva, urine, by embracing, casual kissing, hand shaking, working together, taking bath or swimming together with HIV infected person.
  ,
  ,In India, it is migrant population, truck drivers, community sex workers and IV drug abusers who are affected. They, in turn, spread the disease to their wives, children and clients.
  ,
  ,Clinical presentation
  ,
  ,Within a few weeks of being infected, some people get fever, headache, sore muscles and joints, stomach ache, swollen lymph glands or a skin rash for one or two weeks. Most people think it is flu. After the initial illness, patients can remain symptom free for many years (3-10 years), as the CD4 cell count decreases and the immunity decreases the patient first gets minor infection then the severity of infection increases. The last stage of HIV infection is when the CD4 decreases below 200 per micro litre is called AIDS when the patient may succumb to minor illness.
  ,
  ,How to get tested
  ,
  ,If any person wants to get himself tested for HIV, he should go to the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) which provides free testing and counselling. The ICTC centres are present in every district hospital and medical colleges. If a person tests positive, he is referred to the nearest anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre. 
  ,
  ,Treatment
  ,
  ,Once a person is infected with HIV virus, the virus can never be eliminated from the body. However, there are drugs available that can suppress the level of virus in the body. These drugs are available free of cost at all ART centres. Every HIV positive patient may not be started on treatment immediately. The treatment is started on the basis of CD4 count and stage of the disease. The treatment, if started, has to be continued lifelong. It is extremely important to adhere to the treatment so as to prevent failure of the drug regimen.
  ,
  ,Where to go for treatment
  ,
  ,The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) control programme in India through 35 HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Societies and 269 ART centres throughout the country. The ART centre at Sir Sunder Lal (SSL) hospital of BHU provides free HIV testing, treatment, counselling, nutritional advice and AVR drugs to the registered patients.

  ,

  ,
  ,Leaders included that of Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, Jainism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism and representatives from different states. They signed a declaration to remove stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV.
  ,
  ,""We have committed ourselves to create awareness about it. We will spend 5-7 minutes to speak positively about HIV. We will publicly go into houses of HIV-positive people and associate with them. We ourselves will get tested to keep track of our HIV status,"" said Rev J P Heath, a leader living with HIV. ""In a country like this, how much ever doctors get involved, the stigma won’t go without the involvement of people,"" he added.

  ,Laterm the groups will work on other pressing issues like alcoholism and female foeticide.
  ,
  ,MEET THIS LEADER
  ,J P Heath, founder of INERELA+, an international inter-faith network of religious leaders — both lay and ordained — living with HIV, spoke about his experiences.
  ,
  ,An Anglican priest, he found he was HIV-positive 11 years ago. ""I faced many a stigma myself. The first was self-stigma — the fear that you will be rejected by society. Many people do not survive this stage. In the second stage, I was wondering what will happen when the Bishop finds out. I thought I’ll be kicked out of the House. Pressure and stress are not good for HIV. I told him, and he said you can continue working but do not tell anybody else,"" he said.

  ,Heath later raised awareness among his congregation about HIV and when he finally said he was positive, they asked him what was wrong about it. ""HIV does not rob you of your skills and potentials. Around 10,000 interface religious leaders are part of this network,"" he said.
  ,
  ,""Religious leaders are humans. They are not divorced from the reality of life. There’s an additional level of stigma because HIV is associated with immoral sex. They are vulnerable to HIV because they work amidst them. Cases like blood transfusion, tattoos and marriage can be the reasons,"" he said.

"Oct 1, 2010, 01:40 IST",HIV numbers rise behind bars,"
  HYDERABAD: State prisons are turning into , hubs with a three-fold rise in the number of fresh HIV cases detected in various prisons this year. 
  
  ,Figures collated by a state government body which works closely with HIV positive persons throws up the alarming fact: as against the 119 prisoner from across the state who tested positive for HIV in 2009, the count this year has touched 362 as on date. The period between April to August this year alone saw the number touch the 239 mark. Also, HIV accounts for 30 per cent of the average 100-120 prison deaths each year in the state.
  ,
  ,More alarming is the fact that these figures are only approximate. For, there is no mandatory HIV screening of prisoners at the time of admission and thus officials admit that they are not aware of HIV status of many inmates in various state prisons. “Some persons consider HIV tests to be taboo and do not give their consent to be screened. Even though they belong to the high risk group, their status remains unknown,” said R V Chandravadan, project director of , (APSACS).
  ,
  ,With rampant instances of men having sex with men (MSM) once they are secluded from mainstream society and confined to their barracks, this figure is a fair indicator of the vulnerability of other prisoners, which is now manifest in the form of diseases. 
  ,
  ,“A large number of them are presently suffering from genital ulcer disease (GUD) which results from having unnatural forms of sex. Once diagnosed with such diseases, they become ten times more susceptible to acquiring , at a later date,” said a medical practitioner who recently visited and interacted with medical officers of two central prisons in the state. 
  ,
  ,With APSACS having introduced its ‘Raksha’ project in state prisons in February last year as part of which prisoners are screened and those carrying the HIV infection sent for treatment, the mechanism is presently in place. But no decision has been taken yet by the prison authorities to keep a check on the HIV positive count once APSACS concludes its intervention programme next year.

"Sep 30, 2010, 04:09 IST",2.6L HIV patients have no access to treatment,"
  NEW DELHI: Around 3.2 lakh , in India were on life-saving , (ART) in December 2009 — more than 85,000 patients from the previous year. Be that as it may, 2.6 lakh people are still in dire need of ART.
  
  ,According to the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) latest report, “Towards Universal Access”, which tracks progress in achieving the 2010 target for HIV prevention, treatment and care; around 5.8 lakh HIV patients required ART in end-2009.
  ,
  ,Globally, the HIV epidemic continued to be a real public health challenge as around 33.4 million people are suffering from the lethal disease. In 2008 alone, 2.7 million people were newly infected with the virus. 
  ,
  ,According to the report, only one-third of HIV patients have been put on ART, and coverage of prevention interventions is largely inadequate.
  ,
  ,This year, WHO’s revised guidelines on ART for adults and adolescents, including would-be mothers, said ART would be initiated when CD4 cell counts reach or drop below 350 cells/mm3, irrespective of whether the patients have clinical symptoms. As per this count, though an estimated 11 -14 lakh HIV patients in India need ART, only 23% are receiving the treatment.
  ,
  ,The number of pregnant women, who require ART, is pegged at 43,000. But only 21% are covered. Another 30,000-76,000 HIV positive children, too, require ART.
  ,
  ,However, there has been a spurt in the number of HIV tests across the world. For instance, 100 countries had tested 67 million people last year.
  ,
  ,In 82 countries — for which comparable data was available for 2008 and 2009 — the median number of tests performed per 1,000 people had increased from 41 to 50, respectively. ART coverage, among young adults less than 15 years, has gone up from 22% in 2008 to 28% in 2009. 
  ,
  ,Even the percentage of HIV positive pregnant women receiving ART to prevent mother-to-child transmission has increased from 45% in 2008 to 53% in 2009. In end-2009, 5.25 million people were receiving ART in low and middle-income countries, including India, which translates to an increase of over 1.2 million people from the previous year. 
  ,
  ,The report maintains that HIV-related TB remains a cause for concern. In 2008, of the 9.4 million TB cases reported worldwide, an estimated 1.4 million were diagnosed among HIV patients. Though the rate of HIV test and counselling for TB patients is rising, the initiative is insufficient.

  ,Till now, NACO only provided second line treatment to those HIV patients who were part of its ART centres and had become resistant to first line drugs. Those patients on first line treatment in private hospitals or clinics were not eligible.
  ,
  ,Second line treatment is tremendously expensive and not affordable for the common man. Also, it was only available in NACO's ART centres. So, patients who did not get first line treatment in NACO's ART centres perished if they became resistant.
  ,
  ,Solicitor general Gopal Subramaniam informed a Supreme Court Bench comprising Chief Justice S H Kapadia, Justices K S Radhakrishnan and Swatanter Kumar that the health ministry took this decision on Friday. He informed the SC that details of the decision would be intimated through an affidavit in two weeks.

  ,While first line drugs cost NACO Rs 5,000 per patient per year, second line cost them Rs 35,000 per patient per year. Patients, however, get the treatment free of charge.

  ,India is home to an estimated 2.3 million HIV patients of which 6 lakh would require to be on ART. At present, 3.55 lakh HIV patients are receiving first line treatment in 285 NACO ART centres.
  ,
  ,Ten centres have rolled out second line ART to 1,701 HIV patients. Five more centres in Nagpur, Pune, Salem, Aurangabad and Surat have been trained to start second line ART while two centres in Vijayawada and Hubli are being prepared.
  ,
  ,India rolled out second line ART for the first time on December 1, 2008 in Mumbai's J J Hospital and Chennai's Tambaram ART centre.

  ,A CD-4 count test is used to gauge immunity levels of an HIV-infected patient and to assess whether damage caused by the virus requires life-saving ART. The CD-4 count in healthy adults ranges from 500 to 1,500 cells per cubic millimetre of blood. In HIV infected people, it goes down by 60 cells per cubic millimetre of blood per year as HIV progresses. ART is administered when an HIV positive person registers a CD-4 count under 200.

The rest were born through normal delivery. ""We screened more than 10,000 pregnant women admitted at AIIMS under `Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission' programme. Of these, 128 women tested positive for the disease. Fifteen percent opted for termination of the pregnancy while others were operated on and given the required drugs,'' Mittal said.
  ,
  ,Lalit Kumar, a counsellor at AIIMS, said that 75% of the HIV positive mothers treated by the departments were from the cities, including Delhi. ""There were some cases in which the women were found positive for HIV and the male counterpart tested negative. This led to tension in the family and their relationship was on the verge of breaking. But after the birth of the child, the family was happy,'' said Kumar.
  ,
  ,The treatment included doses of Nevarapin to the mother during delivery, followed by a single dose to the infant within 72 hours of birth. Except for one child who died within hours of birth as he was infected before the mother reached us, all children are safe and have tested negative for HIV, said Dr Mittal.
  ,
  ,Out of 84 children born, 47 have completed their periodical tests of 18 months and have tested negative for the infection. ""These children can live a healthy life now. We hope good results for other children too,'' said Dr Mittal. She said that breast feeding can also lead to transmission of HIV infection, so most of the mothers have been advised against it.
  ,
  ,According to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), every year, more than 7 lakh children become HIV-positive via transmission from their parents across the world. Some 15-20% are infected during pregnancy, 50% during delivery and 33% through breastfeeding.

  NEW DELHI: Around 1.2 lakh Indians got infected with , last year, even though the incidence rate of new cases has fallen in the country by over 50% in the last decade. At present, India, which has 2.4 million HIV patients, ranks third after South Africa and Nigeria. However, the country's HIV prevalence is still low at .31% — from .36% in 2006.
  
  ,Be that as it may, though seven lakh HIV+ Indians require the life-saving anti-retroviral (ART) drugs, only three lakh have access to the medicine. As far as mother-to-child transmission of HIV is concerned, India recorded 18,000 pediatric HIV births off 65,000 HIV+ mothers. India records 27 million pregnancies a year.
  ,
  ,These are the latest data from the 2010 AIDS epidemic report — the most comprehensive report on a single disease that was released by , on Tuesday. For the first time, experts say the HIV epidemic is on the wane. At least, 56 countries have either stabilised or achieved significant fall in rates of new HIV infections.
  ,
  ,""For the first time, we can see the world beginning to truly reverse the AIDS epidemic. Globally, it had peaked in 1999-2000. In Asia, it had peaked in 2003-04. The biggest problem in India is that too many people don't know that they are infected with HIV.

  NEW DELHI: The same drug used for treating , can also prevent gay and bi-sexual men from getting infected in the first place.
  
  ,In a landmark study, announced on Tuesday, scientists have found that , -- a single daily pill containing two drugs that is being used by HIV patients -- actually reduces the risk of contracting the virus by at least 44%.
  ,
  ,In what is being hailed as the biggest success in finding a prevention tool against the deadly HIV, the iPrEx study -- published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) -- found that those, who popped the pill more than 90% of the time, were 73% less susceptible to contract HIV.
  ,
  ,The study, which involved nearly 2500 high-risk gay men, is significant because it gives credence to an HIV prevention approach called oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which involves the use of anti-retrovirals (ART) by those who are HIV-negative and at high risk of infection.
  ,
  ,The findings come only a few months after an African study by the Microbicide Trials Network (MTN) showed that a microbicidal gel can help protect women from contracting the virus.
  ,
  ,""iPrEx has proved the concept of oral PrEP, and now its up to the field to build on this success and work towards realising the full potential of this promising approach in different at-risk populations, such as injection drug users and women. I am now convinced that there will be a day when we have several safe and effective methods for preventing HIV,"" said ,, professor and director of reproductive infectious disease research at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.
  ,
  ,The iPrEx study involved 2,499 participants from Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, the US, South Africa and Thailand who were randomly assigned to one of two study groups: Truvada (a combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine) or Placebo. All participants received safe sex counselling and free condoms, and were tested for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) during their monthly visit right through the programme.
  ,
  ,Of the 1,248 participants assigned to the Placebo group, 64 acquired HIV during the study as compared to 36 of the 1,251 in the Truvada group.
  ,
  ,""The findings of this study have immense implications for the entire HIV prevention field, but most notably for global efforts focused on the population of men who have sex with men engaging in unprotected receptive anal intercourse,"" said MTN investigator ,. 
  ,
  ,What about the concerns that people who take PrEP could develop drug resistance if they become infected with HIV?

  MUMBAI: In tune with the global trend, the , epidemic appears to be slowing down in Mumbai as well. For decades the city was infamous for being the HIV capital of India, but figures available with the , show that for the third consecutive year the HIV incidence is falling.
  
  ,If 5,420 AIDS cases were registered in 2007, there were only 2,942 cases in 2008 and 1,308 cases in 2009. ""So far this year, we have registered 966 cases,"" said MDACS chief Dr S S Kudalkar, adding that the epidemic is clearly on the wane.
  ,
  ,The city has many reasons to cheer on the HIV/AIDS front. Many of the indicators that are used to assess the epidemic's spread in the general population show a downward trend. The virus is lower than ever before among pregnant women, dipping from 1.24% in 2005 to 0.53% in the first 10 months of 2010. Public health experts say this unsuspecting segment provides the best indicator of the disease's presence in the general population.
  ,
  ,People who queue up voluntarily to donate blood provide another indicator of HIV's presence in the society: seropositivity has fallen from 1.06% in 2002 to 0.46% in 2009. In the period up to October 2010, only 903 from 2,19,332 donors tested positive for HIV. ""This means only 0.41% were positive,"" said Kudalkar.
  ,
  ,But the statistic that the MDACS director is most pleased about is the dipping number of deaths among HIV-positive people whose disease progressed to full-blown AIDS. At the height of the AIDS epidemic, say in 2004, the death rate stood at 8.67% among the 3,205 AIDS patients identified that year. This year, the rate has fallen to 3.7%—that is, 36 deaths among 966 patients. ""It is obvious that with better availability of ART (,), patients are leading healthier and longer lives than before,"" said Kudalkar.
  ,
  ,The downward trend in Mumbai is not surprising as the recently released , organization's figures show. Globally, HIV infection rates have fallen by nearly 20% in the last 10 years to 2.6 million in 2009 from 3.1 million in 1999. Also, AIDS-related deaths have come down by 20% in the same period across the world. UNAIDS showed that India has 2.4 million HIV patients at present. The only factor clouding the happy picture is the fact that though seven lakh HIV-positive Indians need ART, less than half have access to it.
  ,
  ,In Mumbai, ART access improved only because more centres started distributing the life-saving drugs in the last few years. In Mumbai, MDACS statistics show that 24,086 of 52,828 HIV-positive patients registered for care in the city received ART in the period between 2006 and 2010.

  VARANASI: It is not easy for a seven-year-old child living with , or even his/her parents to talk about the miseries of life before the civil society. But, on the eve of the World AIDS Day, many children living with HIV/AIDS and their parents assembled in the city on Sunday and shared their life experiences and problems, like the discrimination and humiliation they faced in the society. Though there is a programme and facilities to control HIV/AIDS, most of them felt themselves excluded from the society. 
  
  ,It was an initiative of the Uttar Pradesh Welfare for People Living with HIV/AIDS (UPNP+) with the support of UNICEF and Media Nest to give a voice to such persons and create awareness among people. Around 15 children from different districts including Varanasi, Chandauli, Jaunpur, Mirzapur and Bhadohi attended the programme.
  ,
  ,""In Varanasi, there are 60 children of 5-14 age group who are infected with HIV,"" president of Banaras Network of Positive People Living with HIV/AIDS Society (BNP+) Manoj Kumar Singh informed TOI. According to him, the number of children living with HIV/AIDS (CLHA) in the eastern UP is over 500. The Varanasi district has over 1,000 persons infected with HIV, and the number of such people goes above 11,000 in eastern parts of UP. The UNICEF report estimates that 70,000 children below the age of 15 are living with HIV in India and 21,000 children are infected every year through parent-to-child transmission.
  ,
  ,According to the 2009-10 annual report of the National AIDS Control Organisation (,), demographically the second largest country in the world, India has also the third largest number of people living with HIV/AIDS. As per the provisional HIV estimate of 2008-09, there are an estimated 22.7 lakh people living with HIV/AIDS in India. The HIV prevalence rate in the country is 0.29 per cent (2008-09) and most infections occur through heterosexual route of transmission. However, there are now 33.4 million people living with HIV, according to 2008 figures released by WHO. An estimated 2.7 million were newly infected with the virus and 2 million died of AIDS the same year. To take up the issue World AIDS Day is observed on December 1 to draw together people from around the world to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS.
  ,
  ,In Varanasi, the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre at the , (BHU) is playing a remarkable role. According to the records, so far over 11,000 HIV patients have been registered with the ART Centre, Institute of Medical Sciences, BHU. Around 4,500 patients are living on therapy and get regular medicines. The ART at BHU is one of the 10 centres of excellence in HIV care in the country, where the facility of second line drugs is available. It mentors the activity of 11 ART centres in Bihar, UP and Madhya Pradesh.
  ,
  ,According Kulsum Talha of Media Nest, the children living with HIV should be heard and given due importance to fill them with a sense of respect. They should be encouraged to become a useful component of the society. The , (NACP) III 2007-2012 has the overall goal of halting and reversing the epidemic in India.

While the number of people who accessed the state-run Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) rose from 93,650 in 2008 to 11,53,810 in 2010, the rate of HIV prevalence showed a decline from 16.42% in 2002 to 4.72% in 2010, said Dilip Deshmukh, additional project director of the , (MSACS), on Monday. 
  
  ,""The MSACS has been focusing on strengthening the services and improving its access, especially for the people with high risk behaviours, through targeted interventions across the state,"" Deshmukh said. 
  ,
  ,""The prevention of parent to child transmission (PPTCT) programme, which ensures that every pregnant woman gets screened for HIV and gets medical care has shown remarkable success,"" Deshmukh said. ""In 2002, the HIV prevalence amongst pregnant women was 3.15%. This has been brought down to 0.35%. This year, as many as 8,51,673 women got tested under the PPTCT programme against 21,047 in 2002. For the women in sex work, this rate was contained at 7.4%, a decline of almost 35% from the prevalence of 42.8% in 2004.

  ,
  ,This year three anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres, three second line ART centres and 10 link ART centres have been opened at the district levels, Deshmukh said. ""This has resulted in massive scaling up of the programme with an assurance that even the remote areas get covered."" 
  ,
  ,""Maharashtra remains a primary destination for migrants due to the huge demand for manpower in various sectors, which include unskilled labourers and construction and industrial workers,"" Deshmukh said. ""Risk perceptions among this population are low due to illiteracy and lack of knowledge about HIV. Considering the significance of this issue, the MSACS is launching a state-level communication campaign for migrants from December 2010 to March 2011, covering around 20 districts where migrant population are high. This will ensure that the HIV prevention messages reach out to each and every migrant and he/she is motivated to access the available services,"" he added.

  ALLAHABAD: The rising number of AIDS cases raise a serious concern in the society. With no treatment available for it, prevention is the only way to control AIDS cases. Add to this social stigma, ostracism and multiple legal issues, AIDS gets more complex, specially in countries like India. 
  
  ,HIV the etiological agent of AIDS belongs to the Lentivirus subgroup of the family retroviridae. It is a challenging issue across the world. The virus is present in blood, tissue and all body fluid of infected persons. HIV is spread by sexual contact with infected persons (heterosexual or homosexual), by blood and blood products, and from infected mother to babies.
  ,
  ,About 85% AIDS cases are due to sexual contact 3.80%, 2.05%, 3.34% and 6.46% due to prenatal transmission, blood transfusion, injecting durg users and others respectively.

  ,The World AIDS Day is being observed since December 1, 1988, and aims at raising money, increasing awareness, fighting prejudice and improving education. The theme for this year is ""Universal access and human rights"". World AIDS Day reminds people that HIV still exists and a lot still needs to be done.

  KOLKATA: They were on cloud nine on Wednesday, literally. On board the flight of fancy' were 42 wide-eyed very special children who live with HIV. Their eyes sparkled and their innocent faces lit up with excitement as the Jet Airways flight from Kolkata took off for Bagdogra. On World AIDS Day, these children got a very special gift wings to fly.
  
  ,""Oi dhekho, meghta koto neeche. Amra to tar upore urchhi,"" (Look, the cloud is down below. We are flying high above), exclaimed Rishav Debnath, looking out of the window.
  ,
  ,The six-year-old was abandoned by relatives after his mother succumbed to HIV/AIDS. His father too is HIV-positive and is a daily wage earner in Bongaon. Rishav was rescued by Organisation For Friends Energy & Resources (OFFER) and kept in Anandaghar, a home for the HIV-positive children run by the NGO.

Tina was left with no one to look after as no one knows who her father is.

  MUMBAI: While the state is working hard to contain ,, it seems to have failed to immunize its medical programme against corruption and mismanagement of funds. At least three high-level inquiries are currently underway, in addition to several undercover operations to nab corrupt medical officers.
  
  ,The Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (,) is probing charges of bribery against a medical officer at Thane civic hospital. The officer had allegedly demanded a bribe of Rs 5,000 from the patient to write a prescription for free anti-retroviral drugs. The role of the centre's counsellor is also suspect in the episode. Another inquiry is on against a medical officer who allegedly demanded money to refer a patient for second line HIV/AIDS treatment. There have also been verbal complaints about medical officers demanding bribes to conduct CD4 tests, which are free of cost.
  ,
  ,Project director of MSACS, Dr Ramesh Devkar, said that urgent steps were being taken to curb corruption at ART centres across the state. ""In about a fortnight, we will crackdown on all corrupt officers,"" he said. ""We are very discreet about our plan of action as we do not want to alert any of the wrongdoers,"" he added. Devkar said Pune, Aurangabad and Solapur have emerged as the most notorious districts for corruption.
  ,
  ,The state-run JJ Hospital has to cater to a high number of HIV patients due to the apathy of officials posted at ART centres. A Sawant (32), a resident of Nagpur, was forced to come to JJ after the medical officer refused to change his medication, despite the fact that he had suffered strong drug reactions. ""Once I reached the hospital 10 minutes late. The medical officer threw the file on my face and refused to examine me,"" he said. ""The patients are made to feel guilty for having contracted the virus,"" he said.
  ,
  ,Another patient from Solapur had developed lymph nodes and required immediate medical attention. ""But, the medical officer there referred the patient all the way to Mumbai without giving any medication for temporary relief,"" said head of ART Centre of JJ hospital Dr Alaka Deshpande. ""It calls for supervision of all ART centres,"" she said.

They tied the nuptials in the presence of close family and friends in the city on Wednesday, that was World AIDS Day. The couple’s happiness was evident. “Now I have a company. I have somebody to look after and be looked after by. No one can give you better support than your wife,” said Santosh, who works as a security guard. A few years ago, he lost his first wife to HIV, and he had to hand over his 10-year-old daughter to her grandparents in Mumbai. Geetanjali, a widow, who had to face prejudice in the household once her in-laws found out about her condition in 2002, chose to settled down despite her circumstances. “I have been independent right from the beginning. 
  
  ,I have been earning my own money and have never depended on my parents or siblings for anything. But it was my mother’s unwavering support that helped me take the decision to settle down once again. I want to remain self-reliant, come what may,” said Geetanjali, who works at a tuberculosis centre in Hadapsar. Her 11-year-old son, from her previous marriage, will live with the couple. 
  ,
  ,“We have decided not to have children. My wife and I are going to take care of each other, follow a disciplined lifestyle and lend each other as much moral and emotional support possible,” said Santosh. Disha, an initiative by Deep Griha Society to help HIV-positive people, was instrumental in organising the matrimonial meet in August. Santosh and Geetanjali also sought pre-marital counselling with Disha. “That day, some 12 couples announced their plans to marry. Santosh and Geetanjali are one of the first to get married. For the last few months, they were being counselled on treatment, medication and healthy living,” said ,, coordinator of Disha. The couple wants to pass on a positive message to people living with HIV. “There is nothing wrong with this condition. Consider yourself as normal and healthy and continue living whole-heartedly.

  ,According to mapping estimates of 2009, there are around 23,000 IDUs in the state with HIV prevalence of 26.1%. The national prevalence is 9%. 
  ,
  ,""There has been a four-fold rise in people suffering from HIV in Punjab because earlier we did not include the high-risk group,"" said , additional director NM Sharma. With the state having nearly three times higher number of drug abusers using injections, the problem of HIV has only become more acute. ""The number is more than this and a survey is in progress to fathom the real problem,"" said Sharma.
  ,
  ,""We don’t know the number of HIV infected people. All we know is that we were detecting 4,000 people with HIV every year and the number has gone up to 5,000 per annum,"" he added. Adult HIV prevalence among males is 0.37% and in females, it is 0.26%.
  ,
  ,Chawla said, ""We have started five Opioid Substitution Therapy Centres in Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Batala, Jalandhar and Ludhiana as part of the harm reduction services. The services will be expanded in time to come in other districts as per the programme requirement.""
  ,
  ,What has become a cause for concern is the failure of health authorities to reach out to all those suffering from HIV and providing them adequate medical care. About 16,110 were registered in HIV Care till October 2010, but only half, about 8,890, were put on , (ART) in the state. The numbers of those on medicine have only dwindled — with just 6,045 currently on ART in the state.

  ,""A total 21,404 prisoners in Maharashtra's prisons were screened in the last two years. Of them, 4,472 inmates were from Yerawada Central Jail. Among them, 120 were detected with HIV infection which is the highest in the state,"" said ,, additional project director of the , (MSACS) told TOI on Monday
  ,
  ,Of the 467 HIV infected prisoners, 87 have been put on antiretroviral treatment as their CD4 count is less than 250, said Deshmukh. 
  ,
  ,CD4 cells are specialised cells that protect the body. HIV attacks these cells and uses them to spread the virus which weakens the immune system.
  ,
  ,People without HIV infection have about 700 to 1000 CD4 cells in a drop of blood. HIV infected people are considered to have normal CD4 counts if the number is above 500 CD4 cells in on blood drop.
  ,
  ,Health experts say that prisoners can be HIV infected if they participate in unprotected sex or share infected needles while using illicit drugs.
  ,
  ,They also maintained that the HIV infection rate among prisoners was lower than the general populace that came for testing to integrated counselling and treatment centres at hospitals. 
  ,
  ,""The prevalence rate comes to 2.18 per cent of the total number of prisoners which is below the 4.7 per cent incidence rate in the general population coming to ICTCs for testing,"" said Deshmukh. 
  ,
  ,""The presence of HIV infected persons and those at high risk in prisons is a critical challenge. Unlike the general population, many prisoners may not be aware if they are infected with HIV. Often, vastly crowded living conditions lead to such behaviour among prisoners,"" said A L Kakrani, professor and head department of medicine D Y Patil Medical College. He is also an ex-member of the technical resource group of the Government of India on ART. 
  ,
  ,""The tedious prison environment, lack of occupation of mind and body and plain boredom lead to accumulated frustration and tension. This environment leads to the high-risk activities such as use of drugs and unprotected sex between men,"" Kakrani said. 
  ,
  ,The history of five HIV infected inmates at Yerawada jail has revealed that they were MSM (men having sex with men), said Sudhakar Ingale, counsellor of the ICTC centre at the jail. ""We are spreading awareness about the risks associated with MSM among the prisoners,"" he said.
  ,
  ,A recent UNAIDS report says that the HIV epidemic in Asia was concentrated largely among people who inject drugs, sex workers (FSW) and their clients, and MSMs. About 90 per cent of those newly infected with HIV in India were believed to have acquired it during unprotected sex.

  ,The ICTC facilities 
  ,
  ,The Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) facilities were started at Yerawada and Amravati jails by the MSACS as a pilot project on October 2, 2008 . The move came following a directive by the Bombay High Court.
  ,
  ,The ICTC facilities with full-time counsellors and technicians have been started at five more jails including Nashik, Taloja, Kolhapur, Aurangabad and Nagpur. The other jails in the state send the inmates for testing and counselling to government hospitals that have ICTC facilities.
  ,
  ,""There are no plans to set up full-fledged ICTCs in all the prisons in the state. Earlier, a proposal was sent to the National AIDS Control Society of India (NACO), but they are ready to extend only training if the state government recruits workforce,"" said Deshmukh. 
  ,
  ,An integrated counselling and testing centre is a place where a person is counselled and tested for HIV, on his own free will or as advised by a medical practitioner.

However, the study underlines the fact that the children have very little awareness about the transmission of , through other routes like infected syringes, needles etc. This, researchers say, is an important gray area that needs to be addressed.
  
  ,""The environment in which the children of sex workers live exposes them to drug pushers, drug peddlers and the sharing of needles for injecting drugs. These are potential risk factors for the transmission of HIV infection. The study assumes significance as the thrust has always been only on creating awareness on avoiding transmission through unprotected sex,"" said paediatrician Sharad Agarkhedkar, professor and head of the department of paediatrics at the D Y Patil Medical College under whose guidance the study was carried out.

  ,Adolescent children in the age group of 10 to 15 years were selected for the study. They were given a pre-standardised questionnaire in which they had to answer the questions. Their anonymity was assured. The questionnaire was translated into Marathi by experts, for students.

  ,""The social status of commercial sex workers widely affects their children. These children are exposed to the problems from a very young age and it is important to spread awareness about HIV/AIDS among them,"" said Tambolkar . ""The particular adolescent age group was chosen because they are largely exposed to unsafe sex and also to other potentially dangerous objects of transmitting infection like infected syringes, needles etc.""

They were relatively well informed about HIV causing decreased immunity and its spread by unsafe sex but they were ignorant about its spread by infected syringes, needles etc. This is important as these children may be exposed to such things due to the environment in which they live,"" said Shah. 
  ,

  ,‘‘Given the scale of the problem faced by the HIV positive patients in obtaining maintenance dialysis in government hospitals, this court is of the view that it is inadequate to reserve just one bed each in two hospitals of Government of NCT, Delhi. In a time-bound manner, at least one bed must be reserved in each of the other hospitals functioning under Government of NCT, Delhi, which are otherwise providing dialysis facilities,’’ said Justice S Muralidhar in an order. 
  ,
  ,Seeking an affidavit within eight weeks from Delhi government’s department of health and family welfare, the court asked the Delhi government to inform the court the time and schedule within which one bed each can be reserved in other government hospitals under them. The court’s direction came after an affidavit filed by the Union health ministry through its counsel Jatan Singh said the Centre has taken a decision to provide dialysis facilities to each of the hospitals under Delhi government. The court was hearing a petition filed by a HIV-positive patient seeking a direction to AIIMS and other government hospitals which failed to provide him dialysis.

Their further attempt to deny employment to them is again not only unwarranted but also contrary to the dictum laid down by various courts and the policy of the ,.""
  ,
  ,The matter relates to two candidates — identified merely as ‘Mr X’ and ‘Mr Y’ — who were sponsored by the employment exchange for driver posts.
  ,
  ,While Mr Y had passed plus two, Mr X had served in the Army for eight years.In October 2009 and November 2009, they were considered for appointment and sent to panel doctors for the medical fitness certificate. After their blood samples tested HIV positive, the doctors said they were ‘unfit’ for appointment as drivers.
  ,
  ,Interestingly, the blood test was not conducted in any specialised laboratory; neither was it done with the consent of the candidates. Also, no prior information or pre-test and post-test counselling was provided by the laboratory. Without heeding to requests, the doctors forwarded the ‘report’ to the transport corporations with findings that they were unfit for employment.
  ,
  ,Responding to the writ petition, the managements contended that the candidates were HIV-positive and hence not of sound health. There was no fundamental right guaranteed in the Constitution for being selected as driver, it was further submitted.

He said the issue had already been answered by court decisions all over the world, including the Supreme Court of India. Quoting extensively from judgments in the US and South Africa and other courts in India, Justice Chandru pointed out that the guiding principles of India’s national policy on HIV/AIDS was non-discrimination.
  ,
  ,Noting that a test for CD4 count dropping below 350 cells per microlitre of blood alone could be the scientific basis for turning down candidates, he said, ""This is the standard test adopted by the Indian Army."" Every HIV-positive case could not be denied employment, he said.

  NEW DELHI: Remember the Red , — the eight-coach train that covered 25,000 km spreading awareness about ,. India is now working on rolling out Red Ribbon buses that would reach out to the most backward villagers — targets that the chugging train missed out while passing through 22 states and 152 districts in one year.
  
  ,Speaking exclusively to ToI, Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said though the train was first introduced in India in 2007, it was primarily used for creating awareness against HIV.
  ,
  ,In 2010, the ministry decided to use the train to test people for HIV. Doctors, posted on the train and at stations, counselled the patients.
  ,
  ,""The train reached out to eight million people, trained 81,000 and tested 36,000 for HIV. I have asked , (Naco) to identify specific high prevalence districts, where we will send Red Ribbon buses to provide treatment, counselling and talk about safe sex. The buses will have testing and treatment facilities on board,"" Azad said.
  ,
  ,Naco is close to identifying around 35 high prevalence districts in six states — West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Orissa, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh — where the Red Ribbon buses will be rolled out by April.
  ,
  ,A bus, a testing and treatment mobile unit with two doctors and four counsellors will be dedicated for three districts. ""Those being targetted are from backward districts, which the train couldn't reach. Our idea is to contain the virus in small pockets and not let it spread,"" the minister added. The targetted districts are known to be hotspots for migrants to urban areas.
  ,
  ,""The buses and medical unit will teach migrants about safe sex habits and precautions. They will also be encouraged to get tested for HIV before leaving the village and after returning from the city,"" a Naco official said.
  ,
  ,Around 1.2 lakh Indians got infected with HIV in 2010, even though the incidence rate of new cases fell in the country by over 50% in the last decade. India, which has 2.4 million HIV patients, ranks third after , and Nigeria. However, the country's HIV prevalence is still low at 0.31% from 0.36% in 2006. 
  ,
  ,Migrants are believed to be fuelling India's HIV epidemic. This has led Naco to identify 68 main railway stations in districts across 11 states from where migrants usually board long-distance trains for urban areas.
  ,
  ,Studies on the relation between migration and HIV conducted recently by Naco in three popular migration corridors — Ganjam-Surat, Darbhanga-Delhi and Azamgarh-Mumbai — threw up shocking findings. The highest burden of HIV was found to be among migrants, after the high-risk groups like sex workers and men who have sex with men.

  ,According to the 2001 census, 30.1% of the population was considered to have migrated (314 million) — a considerable increase from 27.4% in 1991.

"Jan 28, 2011, 06:20 IST",New method found effective in diagnosing HIV in children,"
  PUNE: Diagnosing , in infants and children has taken a giant leap forward. A new method, using filter paper, allows high-end , (PCR) test to be performed equally effectively on small spots of dried blood rather than a whole blood sample with equal amount of sensitivity and specificity. 
  
  ,A pilot project using this method has been successfully implemented at seven paediatric referral centres across the country by the National AIDS Control Organisation (,) in which a total of 9,000 samples of children, including infants, exposed to the HIV infection, were successfully screened under Early infant HIV diagnosis (EID) programme.
  ,
  ,“The PCR is a high-end test which is used to diagnose babies born to HIV-positive mothers. Traditionally, the test requires a liquid blood sample, which if taken in a rural area and transported to a testing facility, needs to be kept refrigerated. However, the , (DBS) method is easy to prepare in a resource-limited setting and can be stored and shipped to testing facilities without refrigeration. The method has been tested successfully at the seven referral centres,” said Sayan Chatterjee, director-general of NACO, on Thursday. 
  ,
  ,The PCR test using DBS method has proven to be as effective as the PCR using liquid blood samples, with good amount of sensitivity and specificity, he added. The city-based National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) and the B J medical college are among the seven referral centres where the samples were tested with the help of this newer diagnosis method in the last one year. 
  ,
  ,“Out of the 9,000 children, 460 were found to be HIV-positive. In order to reconfirm the results, tests were also conducted on the whole blood samples to substantiate the findings,” said B B Rewari, NACO’s national programme officer. If not treated, an HIV-positive child has a 35 per cent chance of dying by his/her first birthday and a 53 per cent chance of dying before the age of two. But if the baby receives prophylactic antibiotics soon after birth and antiretroviral therapy (ART) as soon as it is medically indicated, he/she has a good chance of surviving childhood and living a long, healthy life. 
  ,
  ,“The challenge in resource-limited settings is identifying HIV-positive infants and providing early access to this life-saving medicine,” Rewari said. The National AIDS Control Organisation has now formulated technical and operational guidelines on care of HIV-exposed infants and children below 18 months of age. 
  ,
  ,The 2010 World Health Organisation guidelines recommend that all HIV-positive infants, under two years of age, begin antiretroviral treatment regardless of CD4 count or disease stage. Without antiretroviral treatment, an estimated 50 per cent of the children with HIV will die before the age of two. HIV DNA testing is necessary to make a definitive diagnosis in children below 18 months because of the persistence of maternal antibodies until this age.
 "
"Jan 28, 2011, 06:22 IST",ART for HIV will begin at higher CD4 count soon,"
  PUNE: The cut-off level to begin anti-retroviral treatment (ART) for people living with , (PLHIV) is set to be raised to 350 CD4 count from the existing 250. The move is expected to bring in better quality of living and help avert co-infections among the HIV infected.
  
  ,“The current evidence in HIV management suggests that antiretroviral therapy should be recommended to those with HIV whose CD4 cell counts are below 350 cells/mm3, from the current threshold which is 250,” said Sayan Chatterje, director-general of National AIDS Control Organisation (,). He was in the city to attend the three-day consultative meeting on ‘Galvanising Evidence for HIV Management’ that started at the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) in Bhosari on Thursday.
  ,
  ,There is widespread consensus that ART should be initiated when CD4 counts drop below 350, and this recommendation is supported by data from cohort studies and results from randomised control trials (RCT), he added. Standard antiretroviral therapy (ART) consists of the use of at least three anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs to suppress the HIV virus and stop its progress. “Huge reductions have been seen in rates of death and suffering when use is made of a potent anti-retroviral regimen,” Chatterjee said.
  ,
  ,B B Rewari, NACO’s national programme officer (ART), said, “The guidelines for administering ART which is at present given to HIV infected people with CD4 count less than 250 is all set to be revamped. It will be like the US once the cut-off level to get ART treatment is raised to 350 CD4 count.”
  ,
  ,An earlier start to antiretroviral treatment boosts the immune system and reduces the risks of HIV-related death and disease. It also lowers the risk of co-infection like tuberculosis, Rewari said. In 2006, WHO recommended that all patients start ART when their CD4 count (a measure of immune system strength) falls to 200 cells/mm3 or lower, at which point they typically show symptoms of disease. Since then, studies and trials have clearly demonstrated that starting ART earlier reduces rates of death and disease. 
  ,
  ,WHO has now recommended that ART be initiated at a higher CD4 threshold of 350 cells/mm3 for all HIV-positive patients, including pregnant women, regardless of symptoms. “There is enough current evidence that suggest that the ART be initiated at a higher CD4 threshold of 350 cells/mm3. The recommendations churned out of this conference will serve to make policy decision in respect of the change in treatment guidelines,” said Nari’s director Ramesh Paranjape.

  ,
  ,The incidence of the babies born with , also has been low, claims the hospital. “We cannot say exactly how many babies were born HIV positive, as many mothers do not return to get their babies tested. But our estimation says that of all the HIV-positive deliveries, 5-10% of babies get the mother-to-child transfusion,” said Dr Daver, who is also the head of positive parent to child transfusion (PPTCT).
  ,
  ,The hospital has achieved the feat with the help of a certain medicine and delivery method. “According to the guidelines, we give nevrapin before the delivery. We prefer doing a normal delivery—one without making any incisions—to avoid mixing of the mother’s blood with the baby’s. Also, we give the mother the choice to breastfeed, even though there’s a slight chance of virus transmission,” added Dr Daver.
  ,
  ,Maharashtra District AIDS Control Society (MDACS), however, agrees that the load of conducting deliveries of HIV-positive women has largely fallen on public hospitals. “Public hospitals get majority of HIV-positive pregnant women as private hospitals do not want to do these deliveries. While the number of HIV-positive women directly coming to the public hospitals is high, those referred from private hospitals is equally high,” said Dr S S Kudalkar, project director of MDACS.
  ,
  ,Dr Y S Nandanwar, head of obstetrics and gynecology at Sion Hospital said that they may have assisted in 1,000 positive deliveries too. “We do not have the exact record, but the incidence of conducting an HIV-positive delivery is 1% in our hospital. Since we conduct more than 10,000 normal deliveries in a year, we must be conducting around 100 HIV-positive deliveries,” he said.

  NEW DELHI: India could soon see a national medical insurance policy for people living with HIV (PLHIV).
  
  ,In a meeting with insurance companies and the , on February 3, the National , Control Organisation (,) will press them to make insurance ""inclusive and universal for PLHIV"".
  ,
  ,Currently, HIV is excluded from all insurance policies available in the country ""violating the national mandate of providing stigma free care and support services"".
  ,
  ,Union health ministry officials said that , which was earlier regarded as a ""incurable disease"" has now become a ""manageable health problem"" and, therefore, should be included in medical insurance policies.
  ,
  ,""Right now, there are individual health schemes in some states which cover certain healthcare related costs of PLHIV. Many health insurance policies exclude services to PLHIV and there is need for a package designed specially for such people. We will discuss global best practices to see how a viable insurance policy can be created for them,"" joint secretary Aradhana Johri told TOI.
  ,
  ,Another ministry official said, ""Those living with HIV are living longer and have less morbidity cases, thanks to the increase in anti-retroviral therapy (ART) coverage. With timely initiation of ART, PLHIV may live a normal life up to 20 more years. Companies need to realize that covering HIV patients with a medical policy is no more a loss making proposition.""
  ,
  ,India with a HIV prevalence rate of 0.31% is home to the third largest number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the world -- 23.9 lakh.
  ,
  ,Some countries with higher prevalence rates of HIV have already taken measures to mainstream HIV through commercial health insurance cover. These include South Africa (17.8), Namibia (13.1), Uganda (6.5), Guyana (1.2) and United States (0.6).
  ,
  ,K K Abraham, chief of Indian Network of People Living with HIV, said, ""Insurance is life saving for us.""
  ,
  ,At present, only Star Health and Allied Insurance has an insurance policy for PLHIVs in four states -- Karnataka, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. More than 7,000 PLHIVs have subscribed to this insurance which provides a health cover of Rs 30,000 with a yearly premium Rs 1,511.
  ,
  ,NACO says that with about 89% of all HIV/AIDS infections being in the 15-49 age group, it effects in the most productive years. Currently, the financial burden of treatment and care is shared by NACO and PLHIVs. While NACO pays for ART, PLHIVs face economic burden of travel, nutrition and loss of wages.
  ,
  ,Recently, India launched the national health insurance scheme, Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY), for BPL. It is to be rolled out in 366 districts in 29 states. As on December 23, 2010, a total of 22,354,462 smart cards have been issued across 260 districts in 27 states.
  ,
  ,NACO says, ""HIV has been taken out from the exclusion list making it possible for poor PLHIVs to be covered under health insurance, which can make them entitled to one time hospitalization for nearly 700 in-patient procedures with costs up to Rs 30,000 by paying a minimal registration fee of Rs 30 per annum.""

  MUMBAI: The fate of a 20-month-old HIV positive boy is hanging in the balance, thanks to the 'apathy' shown by the Central Adoption Resources Agency (,), the Bombay high court was told on Tuesday. 
  
  ,A Spanish couple had earlier decided to adopt the boy. However, given the delay by CARA in granting a No Objection Certificate (NOC), the couple has now decided against it, said Shirin Merchant, the advocate representing the couple as well as the boy.
  ,
  ,A division bench of Chief Justice Mohit Shah and Justice S J Vajifdar was irked to hear that the delay in granting the NOC has left the boy in the lurch and that he will now have to wait till another couple decides to adopt him. The boy was given for adoption by the ,, which faced suspension following complaints of financial malpractice and human trafficking last year.
  ,
  ,""The boy was born to a HIV positive mother and had symptoms of the disease. A Spanish couple still agreed to adopt him in February 2010 and started the formalities, but following CARA's decision to suspend Preet Mandir's licence, the formalities were not completed. Even the boy's health is deteriorating,"" Merchant told the court.
  ,
  ,Merchant is representing six more foreign couples who agreed to adopt eight children from Preet Mandir. Three couples are from Spain and Italy, one is from Canada.
  ,
  ,Hearing Merchant's submissions, the judges remarked: ""You (government) are not considering the condition of these children. Unnecessary delay is not only creating hurdles in the adoption procedure, but also seriously affecting welfare of the children who have been selected for adoption.""
  ,
  ,Merchant told the court that there are 86 children with Preet Mandir waiting for adoption. Of the eight selected for adoption, one is suffering from Hepatitis B and another has a severe orthopaedic problem. ""But the couples still want to adopt them. They can get better treatment once they are adopted,"" Merchant said.
  ,
  ,Preet Mandir came under the scrutiny of various authorities following a sting operation carried out by a news channel showing that the adoption house sells babies for more money to foreign parents. Sakhee-a Non governmental Organisation (NGO) had filed an application in 2008 seeking an inquiry against Preet Mandir.

  ,Preet Mandir's counsel, senior advocate Prasad Dhakepalkar said that the CBI had in 2010 lodged an FIR against just one of the trustees. ""The government should not shut down the adoption facilities because of this FIR. CARA has delayed filing its reply, thereby affecting the adoption procedure,"" Dhakepalkar said.

  Ludhiana: In order to diagnose HIV early in newborns, the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) has decided to launch a programme. Earlier, , used to diagnose the HIV status after the baby had turned four months old. However, the new programme would enable them to check the baby when it would be just one month old. The main motive of early diagnosis would be detection of the virus at an early stage to prevent its spread in babies. 
  
  ,Talking to TOI, AIDS district project manager Geetika said NACO had been running an HIV diagnosis programme among newborns to detect the presence of HIV virus among children of HIV-infected mothers. ''Now we'll be able to detect the virus when the baby is just one month hold, thus increasing the chances of preventing AIDS,'' she added. 
  ,
  ,According to the prevention programme, HIV-infected women are given medicine during their pregnancy and a dose is given to the newborn at the time of birth. However, other tests are conducted to confirm the presence of HIV infection in the child as well as the mother, said she. 
  ,

  MUMBAI: Commonsense suggests that every sample of blood or fluid drawn from an HIV-positive person would be the same. But a group of researchers in the city has found otherwise.
  
  ,Scientists at the National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (,) have found in the case of a patient that the genetic sequence of the , virus in his blood sample was different from that in his sperm. The institute, located in Parel, operates under the Indian , (ICMR).
  ,
  ,The NIRRH team, led by assistant director Dr Atmaram Bandivdekar, studied samples of HIV patients registered at the J J Hospital. ""We have so far studied blood and semen samples taken from 10 men,"" said Bandivdekar.
  ,
  ,Dr Alaka Deshpande, in charge of the hospital's anti-retroviral centre, said the study was part of continuing research about HIV-discordant couples of whom only one partner has the virus.
  ,
  ,The findings shocked the doctors. The genetic sequence of the virus found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was found to be different from that in the spermatozoa.
  ,
  ,The finding is significant because it underlines the virus's instability. ""HIV is so weak that it cannot replicate completely. Hence, its genetic sequence keeps changing as seen from the same patient's blood and semen samples,"" said Bandivdekar.
  ,
  ,He believes this continual change is the reason behind medicine's failure to cure a person of HIV or its full-blown manifestation ,. ""If the genetic sequence keeps changing, how can we find one medicine to cure all? 
  ,
  ,The findings are going to be published in the forthcoming issue of the ,.
  ,
  ,But for both Bandivdekar and Deshpande, the study's significance lies in that it settles a longstanding debate in the medical fraternity. ""We can no longer say that sperms are 100% free of the virus,"" said Deshpande (it is largely believed that HIV doesn't affect sperms and is found only in seminal fluid).
  ,
  ,Bandivdekar said the finding would impact the current practice of allowing HIV-positive men to have their own children using infertility treatment. ""While making a test-tube baby in a laboratory, the sperm of an HIV-positive man is washed. But we have to now study if the sperm-wash is indeed completely safe in not transmitting the virus to the embryo.""
  ,
  ,Deshpande, however, said that many European countries nowadays subjected the HIV-positive man to a regimen of drugs to bring down the viral load in his body. ""Thereafter his sperm is washed and IVF is performed.'

  ,An eight-month-old baby boy suffering from hydrocephalus (a condition of accumulation of fluids in the brain) was scheduled to be operated at around 2 pm on Monday but the surgery started only around 7 in the evening. The child was kept hungry throughout the day, alleged his parents. 
  ,
  ,Neurosurgeons, who carried out the operation, alleged that the delay was due to the anaesthetist, who came in late. The surgeons waited for over five hours in the OT. The anaesthetist attended the operation only after the intervention of the hospital superintendent. ""We had informed the anaesthetist about the surgery in the morning but he did not turn up. We waited for five hours to carry out the operation,"" head of the neurosurgery department S S Mishra alleged. There are allegations that the anaesthetist was hesitant to attend to a HIV positive patient.
  ,
  ,Refuting the allegations, the anaesthetist Narayan Acharya said, ""The delay in operation has nothing to do with the patient being HIV positive. The child was very sick and special intervention as venesection (where a vein is surgically opened to obtain intravenous access) was required to administer anaesthesia to the patient. 
  ,
  ,But the doctors had not completed the preparations for the surgery on time. I had visited the ward twice but the surgery was delayed due to lack of co-ordination on their part.""
  ,
  ,But the worst sufferer was the child and his parents. ""The day was painful for us. We also suffered along with our child. The hospital allotted us time for surgery 20 days after admission. But the doctors delayed the process,"" mother of the child said, who had come all the way from Balipadar in Ganjam district.
  ,
  ,Monday's problem also brought to the fore the insufficient number of anaesthetist in the hospital. Doctors have demanded a team of anaesthetist for the critical department like neuro-surgery. ""Over 30 patients are waiting for surgery in the ward but we are unable to operate them due to unavailability of anaesthetist.

  ,But, all was not well for her 10 years ago. This Class IX dropout, who hailed from Narayanpur village in Kendrapada district, was in her teens when she fell in love with Abhay Behera, a youth of her age. Abhay had just started working at a cloth factory in Surat. 
  ,
  ,""I eloped with Abhay against my family's wishes. It was for me a perfect married life. Well that is what I thought for the next few years,"" Sumitra recalls with a smile. ""Within two years, we were blessed with a baby boy. Both our families had also accepted us by then,"" she says. But she was oblivious of the fact that days after landing in Surat, she had contracted HIV from her husband in 2001. ""I was tested HIV+ during a routine pre-natal check-up during my first pregnancy in 2003. I must have contracted it much earlier, because my husband had been tested positive years ago. I got to know this just five years ago in 2006 during my second pregnancy,"" she narrated. ""Earlier, my husband had hidden his disease from me. He probably thought that since our son had tested negative, there was nothing to worry about. He had debarred me from breastfeeding him giving me some lame reasons, which I did not comprehend, but let go anyway,"" she said.
  ,
  ,When Sumitra was pregnant for the second time, her husband was suffering from high fever that required hospitalisation. They returned to Orissa to treat him. ""That is when he revealed to me our HIV+ status and said that he would not live long. He died two months later,"" Sumitra said. She then got worried and took another test in Kendrapada. There she tested positive. That was not all, her new-born child also tested positive a few months later. That is when she felt the world was crashing down on her.
  ,
  ,Even as she was trying to overcome the grief of her husband's death, villagers started avoiding her and almost ostracised her. ""Both the in-laws and my parents were reluctant to take me in. After much persuasion, my parents agreed to raise my elder son since he had tested negative,"" she recalls.
  ,
  ,""I was thinking of ending my life along with my second child. But then, some HIV/AIDS volunteers counselled me,"" she said tearfully. With her month-old child in tow, Sumitra moved to Angul and started life afresh. She took a job of a maid for an NGO and in turn found shelter. Later, she moved to Bhubaneswar and joined a community centre for AIDS patients as an attendant. 
  ,
  ,""Although her profile is that of a house-keeper, she also helped counsel inmates using her own life story as a case in point,"" says Dr Dilip Samal, convenor of Medics, the NGO that runs the 10-bed indoor facility for AIDS patients. 
  ,
  ,She gets Rs 3,000 a month and accommodation in return for her service.

","
  NEW DELHI: Gurgaon will now be home to the country's first state-of-the-art laboratory that will exclusively work to design an effective vaccine against the deadly , (HIV).
  
  ,The , and Technology Institute (THSTI), an autonomous institute under the department of biotechnology (DBT), and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), have signed an agreement to jointly establish, operate and fund this HIV vaccine design programme.
  ,
  ,The programme will primarily focus on one of the greatest scientific challenges of AIDS vaccine design and development - the search of antibodies capable of neutralizing a broad spectrum of circulating HIV strains. 
  ,
  ,Bringing hope to the idea of developing an effective vaccine against the deadly virus, scientists have been working on powerful new antibodies that neutralise all major forms of the virus. An antibody is an infection-fighting protein produced by our immune system when it detects harmful substances like viruses and bacteria. 
  ,
  ,Scientists say these antibodies would ultimately reveal the Achilles heel of the virus. Studies have found that antibodies target a stable portion of the virus that does not frequently mutate - a defence mechanism that has till now helped the virus escape earlier developed experimental vaccines. 
  ,
  ,Experts in this Indian lab will now look at new antibodies and how they bind to the virus. This will tell scientists which part of the virus to target with vaccines. The idea is to create artificially synthesized mimics of their targets on HIV, to be used in vaccines to elicit similar actions and teach the immune system how to thwart HIV infection.
  ,
  ,""With 7,100 people contracting HIV every day, effective tools to prevent infection are indispensable to the fight against HIV and AIDS. A broadly effective AIDS vaccine would be a powerful asset to efforts to arrest the spread of HIV,"" said ,, secretary of DBT. 
  ,
  ,This collaborative programme will participate in a coordinated, global effort to create replicas of virus targets in the laboratory for use as immunogens, which are the active ingredients of vaccines. The programme will have the task of developing, testing and then implementing strategies to rapidly screen large numbers of immunogens against HIV-1 (dominant strain) and to prioritize them for further evaluation in preclinical studies.
  ,
  ,""We are very excited about the launch of this collaboration,"" said ,, CEO of IAVI.
  ,
  ,Other institutions participating in this partnership include the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology in New Delhi and the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.
  ,
  ,Indians, too, are being screened for such effective HIV slaying antibodies. The country has its share of ""late progressors"" or ""elite controllers"" - people infected with HIV who stay healthy for years without requiring life-saving anti-retroviral treatment (ART). About one in 300 people with HIV is an elite controller.
  ,
  ,Meanwhile, another fascinating community - mainly comprising women - has also got scientists in India excited. Called ""exposed sero negative"" these are women who have, for years, had sex with HIV-positive, condom-refusing husbands, but never got infected. Many have also had babies who are not HIV-positive.
  ,
  ,Scientists are studying these elite controllers to see whether they carry special genes, which prevent the virus from multiplying in their bodies. The cure for AIDS may come from members of these two communities, scientists believe.

  ,
  ,One of the most damaging provisions in the FTA is the grant of data exclusivity, something that the Indian Patent Law does not allow at present as Parliament did not think this would work in the interest of the Indian public’s need for affordable medicines. Data exclusivity would mean that clinical trial data filed by one company cannot be relied upon by any other company. 
  ,
  ,Each company will have to produce its own clinical trial data, which would be a waste of resources as different companies subject people to repeat clinical and pre-clinical trials to prove the efficacy of the same drug. Moreover data submitted by a company will be protected for five to ten years preventing the registration of equally effective generic medicines during the time.

  BANGALORE: They will write their Class X this year. What next? College, one would say. But these students ask: ""Who will admit children like us?''
  
  ,The , with increasing number of schools and colleges still has no place for these HIV +ve students. Even corporation schools do little to accommodate them.
  ,
  ,The students are from Infant Jesus children's home in Kothanur, located on the way to the Bengaluru International Airport. Nishitha, Shalini, Syria and Hemalatha are the first batch of HIV positive children here to write their Class 10 exam this April through the national open school system.
  ,
  ,They are confident they will do the exams well and dream of a bright future. Nishitha wants to become a doctor to find a cure for children like her while Shalini intends to become a teacher who will love students like her.
  ,
  ,But their immediate future remains bleak. The four girls had no answer when asked where they plan to join after class 10. ""We don't know,'' they say.
  ,
  ,The home was inaugurated in March 2001. Even after a decade, it's not easy to find a proper school for these kids. The four had lost a year in between as no school would admit them. They were earlier sent to the corporation school nearby. But could not continue there for long due to the students and some teachers' indifference.
  ,
  ,According to the management here, the few who were admitted to schools came back depressed not willing to get back to any school again. Some even develop aversion to studies. 
  ,
  ,As a way out, the management started a school within the campus. Now with the first batch completing class 10, their major concern is what next. 
  ,
  ,""There are many volunteers and donors willing to help us with money and even in kind. Our greatest challenge remains in finding a proper place to get these children educated without any discrimination. We hope to find a way out soon,'' says sister Pratibha DSS, co-ordinator. 
  ,
  ,She recalls the early years when they had problems even getting cooks. ""Our first cook left within a few days saying her landlord refused to give house to a person working for the HIV positive. It took some years to get over such problems. However, only education remains a block,'' she explained. 
  ,
  ,THE LEGAL SIDE
  ,
  ,According to legal experts, no child can be denied admission in school because he/she is HIV positive. ""The greatest challenge in monitoring such cases of discrimination is that it happens in lower strata of society. Unless somebody raises voice about it, it's difficult to find solutions,'' says state advocate general Ashok Haranahalli. 
  ,
  ,The Bombay High Court on January 20, 2004 had ruled that HIV-positive people cannot be denied jobs. Doing so infringes on their constitutional right to earn a livelihood and right to equality. What about such children's right to education?

  ,
  ,As per official records, Jaisalmer falls under the D category in a scale where A category is for the highest risk and severely affected areas.

  ,
  ,According to officials of the Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RACS), the trend and the rate of spread have not changed much in the district. However, people concerned argue that Jaisalmer may soon make it to the B category. 
  ,
  ,""From 2005 to 2007, only a few hundred tests were done at our testing centre and the number of positive cases were very few. From 2008, the number of tests run into thousands. In 2009-10, 11,000 tests were conducted, of which 61 were positive, which is 0.55%,'' a RACS official said.

""We not only need to ensure that the community is made part of the mainstream, but also continue and scale our efforts to reach the unreached.""

Most of these blood banks are based in the government hospitals and medical colleges/institutions.
  
  ,A government order relating to blood and blood products was issued recently. The order mentions the category of patients who can procure blood and its components free of charges. The category also includes destitute, patients from below poverty line, pregnant women admitted under the Janani Suraksha Yojana, prisoners and disabled. 
  ,
  ,""The decision aims to cut procedural crap to save the lives of persons in need,'' Mani Prasad Mishra, special secretary, who issued the GO, said. Mishra also headed the committee which recommended changes in the government blood and component availaibility policy. ""The said order is going to be of great help to all those who need blood frequently and in large quantity,'' Vinay Manchanda of Haemophilia Society of India said.

  ,
  ,As per the revised rate, a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and whole blood would cost Rs 400. A sum of Rs 200 has been fixed for a unit of fresh frozen plasma and random donor platelets concentrate. Blood component,cryoprecipitate, would be available at Rs 100.
  ,
  ,A universal rate of Rs 850 for blood and its components was fixed by National Blood Transfusion Committee (NBTC) in April 2008. However, the decision invited ire, specially when seen in the context of government and NACO supported blood banks. ""The logic was that NACO was already giving funds to support the blood banks while the patients coming at these centres mainly hailed from poorer sections of the society,'' shared a member.
  ,
  ,The NBTC recommendation for universal charge said that the rates could be subsidised further after approval from its state counterpart -- SBTC. Using its power, the rates of blood in UP came down to Rs 250 for patients undergoing treatment in the hospitals while Rs 500 for other patients. The new order has slashed the rates further. Authorities, however, clarified that the new rates would not be applicable in private sector blood banks.

"Updated: May 12, 2011, 05:17 IST",Another trial for HIV vaccine fails,"
  NEW DELHI: The hunt for an effective vaccine against the lethal HIV remains elusive. 
  
  ,In a phase-II double-blind, randomized test-of-concept study, another promising vaccine candidate — , — has failed to protect the subjects.
  ,
  ,Announced in the , on Thursday, the paper says ""the MRKAd5 HIV-1 vaccine did not prevent HIV-1 infection or lower viral-load. The high incidence rates of HIV highlight the crucial need for intensified efforts to develop an efficacious vaccine.""
  ,
  ,The MRKAd5 HIV-1 vaccine was designed to ensure T-cells-mediated immune responses that would provide complete or partial protection from HIV-1 infection or a decrease in viral load after being administered.
  ,
  ,The study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in five sites in South Africa. The vaccine and placebo were given by intramuscular injections on a 0, 1, 6-month schedule to about 800 subjects.
  ,
  ,It concluded that ""34 participants in the vaccine group were diagnosed with HIV-1 and 28 in the placebo group. There was no evidence of vaccine efficacy. Vaccine efficacy did not differ by sex, age, herpes status or circumcision.""
  ,
  ,Now, all eyes are on two discoveries that were made in 2009. First, there were two powerful new antibodies that neutralized all major forms of the virus from the body of an African man. An antibody is an infection-fighting protein produced by our immune system when it detects harmful substances like viruses and bacteria.
  ,
  ,These two antibodies were also found to target a stable portion of the virus that does not frequently mutate — a defense mechanism that has till now helped the virus escape earlier developed experimental vaccines. Experts are looking at exactly where the antibodies bind to the virus. This will tell them which part of the virus to target with vaccines.
  ,
  ,Researchers believe they can create an effective vaccine if they are able to get the human body to produce such neutralizing antibodies before exposure to HIV.
  ,
  ,Scientists are looking at a trial of a Thai HIV vaccine, which in 2009 successfully had cut the risk of HIV infection in humans by 31%. In the largest human trial of an AIDS vaccine — involving more than 16,000 volunteers in Thailand — scientists found that HIV infections were prevented in over a third of the 8,000 volunteers, who received the vaccine.
  ,
  ,Since HIV was first identified in 1981, 40 millions have been infected with the virus. Annually, an estimated four million new infections occur, of which 90% are in developing countries. AIDS has claimed more than 25 million lives over the past 25 years.
  ,
  ,A vaccine will be a boon for India, where 1.2 lakh new people got infected with the virus in 2009. India, saddled with with 2.4 million HIV patients, ranks third after South Africa and Nigeria as far as HIV burden is concerned.

The double-storey house in Sector 6 of Malviya Nagar looks humble but it is a paradise for these impoverished children who themselves are carriers of the HIV and had faced social stigma after their parents succumbed to the deadly virus or abandoned them.
  
  ,When these children were found abandoned, Smriti Singh, who founded the AIDS care centre under the Faith Foundation, working for HIV positive orphans, adopted them.
  ,
  ,“They are my best friends. To see them grow healthier is my life’s aim,” the samaritan said.
  ,
  ,Smriti is among very few people in the city who came forward to help the HIV positive children. She is fondly called ‘Maa’ by these kids. Everyday, they ran towards the gate to receive her and she, too, doesn’t forget to bring chocolates for them.
  ,
  ,Most of the children aged between six and 16 years were found abandoned in various parts of the state. The latest inmate to join the care centre is eight-year-old Raghu. The pale and thin boy weighs only 12 kilos. He was found HIV positive after his mother was admitted to hospital in 2009. She died after a prolonged illness in 2010. His father left him alone as he left for work in Gujarat. 
  ,
  ,“Most of them were subjected to discrimination in their respective areas. They were ill-treated by their close relatives after knowing their status,” Smriti said. 
  ,
  ,The SMS Hospital, where they were brought initially for treatment, recommended these children to the care centre, which provided them food, shelter and treatment, apart from their schooling at a nearby institute.
  ,“In the school, they never face any problem. They mingle with other kids, play with them and exchange notes,” Smriti said.
  ,
  ,To make the children feel at home, she stuff the centre with toys, puzzles, pool table, cricket and badminton kits. 
  ,The house has four rooms with each of them having colourful paintings and drawing by the children. 
  ,
  ,A special study room with computers and general knowledge charts is also there where the children undergo many activities, including exercises, fun games and puzzles to sharpen their mind.
  ,
  ,On the children’s health, Smriti said, “These kids are prone to seasonal diseases and often require intense medication. Hence, I stocked all kinds of medicines in all corners of house.”
  ,
  ,Kausal, a volunteer at the foundation, said, “I monitor everyone during meals. These kids require nutritional food to help them grow and fight against diseases.”
  ,
  ,To make the life of these children exciting, the foundation plans to take them on a trip to Goa. “The kids are now very excited about their flight to Goa. Throughout the day, they make plans on how they will make most of the trip,” Kausal said.
  ,
  ,Also, volunteers both from India and abroad spend quality time with the children at the home during summer months or their pre-job breaks. “I share happiness and my time with them. It gives me immense pleasure to teach them English,” said Pauline Agache, a language student from Belgium, on her visit to the care home.

We will now request National AIDS Control Organisation, Delhi police and the government to take swift action and sift fake parlours from genuine ones,’’ said a senior official. 
  ,
  ,“Most victims do not lodge complaints as they fear social ostracization. Parlour owners too change their phone numbers frequently and they keep shifting shop from one rented premise to another. We will now take a more holistic approach to the problem,’’ said a police officer.

The statistics show that most of the prisoners among these 340 HIV positive prisoners are intravenous drug users. These prisoners are getting free treatment from jail authorities under the de-addition programme called OST (Opioid Substitution Treatment).
  
  ,Jail sources said that prisoners did not know about their HIV status earlier and when they came to know about such programme in Tihar, they joined the centre. Officials say six to eight percent population of Tihar is HIV positive, but it is a fluctuating figure. “Presently, there are 11,800 prisoners in Tihar and this number keeps on fluctuating. So, HIV positive prisoners’ status is also variable because people come and go and they get treatment while being lodged here. All those at the centre have benefited,” said Sunil Gupta, Tihar spokesperson. 
  , 
  ,In the last three years, around 5,700 prisoners, who have taken drugs at least once in life, have undergone tests at this centre. Before June 2008 Tihar jail had no mechanism to identify the HIV positive inmates and whenever any government agency of National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) asked the authorities, a rough figure was provided. In June 2008, Integrated Counseling and Testing Centre was opened at Tihar with the help of NACO.
  , 
  ,Sunil Gupta said that they have been able to identify such large number of HIV positive prisoners inside only through ICTC and they all were affected with it before they came here.
  , 
  ,Officials said that out of 340 prisoners, 210 are intravenous drug users who have once in their life used injections to consume drugs and they have been repeat offenders in drug abuse. He added that medicines under the treatment of HIV positive are very costly and jail authorities provide these medicines for free to the affected inmates apart from counseling. Earlier, authorities used to send the suspected HIV positive prisoners to Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital for treatment but ICTC is located in jail itself with dedicated counselors. The centre provides treatment with the help of United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), NGOs and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).

  ,The state government has taken new initiatives which include opening of community-based HIV screening of pregnant women by Auxiliary Nursing and Midwifery (ANM) at sub-centre level of A and B category districts like Ajmer, Alwar, Barmer, Ganganagar, Jaipur, Tonk and Udaipur. Also, the state government has opened 11 ICTCs which provide HIV DNA PCR test for early diagnosis of HIV infection in a child.

"Updated: May 29, 2011, 13:55 IST",‘Congress grass’ to help fight HIV virus,"
  ALLAHABAD: The obnoxious weed Parthenium, popularly known as Congress grass, can help in fighting the virus causing HIV-I, claims a study done at the Allahabad University. 
  
  ,Vyom Parashar, a research scholar at AU, has developed a method to transform the extract of the weed of Congress grass into silver nanoparticles which may kill different microbes.
  ,
  ,Silver nanoparticles are the metal of choice as they hold the promise to kill microbes effectively as these microbes generally have a harder time developing resistance to silver than they do to antibiotics, said Vyom, a research scholar under Prof Avinash C Pandey. 
  ,
  ,His finding has been published in Digest Journal of Nanomaterials and Biostructure besides getting a mention in 14 researches done worldwide. 
  ,
  ,Further, Vyom has been asked by Elsevier, a reputed science journal, to write a book and a chapter on usage of biotechnology in the field of nanoscience. 
  ,
  ,Giving more details, Vyom said, “The methodology of converting the leaf of this weed is simple. The extract of the leaf is added to a solution of silver nitrate and within minutes the entire solution turns into silver nanoparticles. Since, the method used for synthesis of these nanoparticles does not use any added chemicals, it is a cost effective and environmental friendly method.”
  ,
  ,Congress grass was introduced in India in 1956. It causes contact dermatitis in livestock and is reported to be poisonous to sheep. Humans too are affected by this weed with respiratory malfunction and dermatitis. 
  ,He said the congress grass would make the farmers reap huge profits as the cost of synthesising one litre of silver nanoparticle is around just Rs 30 whereas the end product can fetch upto Rs 3.5 lakh in the international market. 
  ,
  ,About the methodology, Vyom explained that leaves of congress grass were thoroughly washed thrice in distilled water for 15 min, dried, cut into fine pieces and were boiled with 100 ml of sterile distilled water up to 5 min and were filtered. 
  ,
  ,A team of scientist from various universities of US, including the department of chemical engineering, University of Texas, have reported that silver nanoparticles interact with HIV-1 virus which inhibit the virus from binding to its host cells. 
  ,
  ,Parthenium is responsible for the largest number of skin inflammation cases caused by contact with the plants surface, said Vyom. “I experimented with carrot grass as the pollen grains cause diseases like eczema, asthma and dermatitis.” he added.

"Jun 2, 2011, 02:10 IST",Nursing institute for HIV patients remains a non-starter,"
  CHENNAI: More than two years after the foundation stone was laid, the city's first post-graduate nursing institute dedicated to treating HIV+ patients in Tambaram remains a , due to shortage of funds.
  
  ,On November 1, 2008, the then union minister for health and family welfare, Anbumani Ramdoss, laid the foundation stone for the Rs 28 crore-Indian Institute of Advanced Nursing at Tambaram Sanatorium. Little work has happened since then. ""As many organisations, both public and private, are involved, mobilisation of funds and co-ordination between different organisations have been challenges in executing the project,"" sources in the state health department told The Times Of India.
  ,
  ,The nursing institute a unique public-private partnership venture with state-of-the-art facilities was dedicated to train nurses providing healthcare to HIV+ve patients in the country. A joint venture of the Union ministry of health and family welfare, National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS), Indian Nursing Council, William J Clinton Foundation and Yale University, the institute was slated to come up on a five-acre plot near the National Institute of Siddha at the Government Hospital of Thoracic Medicine (GHTM).
  ,
  ,The idea to set up such an institute, according to sources, was that the GHTM is not only a centre of excellence for treating HIV+ve persons in the country but is also the largest hospital in giving treatment for these patients in the country. At present, the hospital gives treatment for around 4,000 HIV+ve persons. ""The institute was also aimed to act as a national hub for nursing, research and training in HIV/AIDS-related cases,"" sources added.
  ,
  ,As per plan, the union health ministry has given Rs 5 crore as seed money for the Rs 28-crore project. The Clinton Foundation is responsible for raising the rest of the funds, and Yale University will provide expertise in training. On its part, the state government through TANSACS has given the land for the institute. The feasibility study for the project was done in 2006 by the Union health ministry through NACO. 
  ,
  ,At present, the state has around 10% of the total HIV affected persons in the country and ranks fourth after Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka.
  ,
  ,There is a shortage of 15 lakh nurses in the public health sector in India. During the 11th Plan, the Centre had allotted Rs. 3,900 crore to the nursing sector alone for building human resources, expanding infrastructure and creating four centres of excellence in Chennai, New Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkatta. In Tamil Nadu, the state government had granted permission to the private sector for starting 50 nursing schools and colleges.

  PERUNKARANAI (CHEYYUR): Children affected by the , (HIV) have been stigmatised in Perunkaranai, near Melmaruvathur — a little over 130 km south of Chennai. Some 30 ,, including 13 girls, studying between class 3 and 8 in Chitamur Panchayat Union Middle School have been forced to stay away from the school since September 2010.
  
  ,The students had been going to the school in Perunkaranai since 2008, but their HIV status was largely unknown except to the school principal and the village panchayat president. “Some parents came to know about the children’s status through some teachers who were coming from the city last year, and raised the issue at the PTA meetings. They felt uneasy in sending their wards where some children are infected with HIV,” said K Panchanathan, head master, Chitamur Panchayat Union Middle School.
  ,
  ,The students are under the care of an NGO Arias Home of Hope. Before admitting them to the school in 2008, Arias Home had told the principal of the school about the children being HIV positive. The panchayat president also knew. The principal and the president had thought it better to not discuss the children’s health situation with others. But word got around. 
  ,
  ,Rumours started spreading about HIV in the village. Some came to believe that the infection could spread through water, sharing food and urinals. “Many villagers did not want these children sharing space with other normal students. We were unable to convince them,” P S Elappan, president, Perunkkaranai village, one of the 42 villages in Chitamur Panchayat Union, in Kancheepuram, told The Times Of India.
  ,
  ,The children are undergoing free Anti Retro Viral Therapy (ART) at the Government Hospital of Thoracic Medicine (GHTM) in Tambaram Sanatorium. The NGO activists are taking classes for these students on their own under the Sarva Sisyan Abhiyan’s (SSA) Education For All scheme, which aims to provide education mainly for school dropouts.
  ,
  ,The NGO cites distance between the school and the home as a reason to withdraw the students from the panchayan union school. “Distance between the school and our home is around two kms and our children had to miss ART on many occasions as they found it difficult to come home during lunch and get ART and return to school again. I can’t say anything more as the issue is in the court,” Pannerselvam, program manager, Arias Home of Hope, told TOI.
  ,
  ,On May 30 this year, the Madras high court ordered notice to the school on a public interest litigation relating to this issue. The court also ordered notice to health and educational departments on the PIL filed by K Radhakrishnan of Chengalpet. The petitioner Radhakrishnan, who himself is an HIV-affected person, said that the children had the right to have free and compulsory education and refusal of education to them was a violation of fundamental right.

  IMPHAL: Amid contradictory claims, a woman in Imphal was killed by her husband for not disclosing to him that she was HIV positive. A large number of NGOs strongly reacted against the unprecedented homicide. This comes at a time when government agencies and NGOs have intensified their ongoing awareness programme on ,.
  
  ,Truck driver M Ibomcha confessed that he, in a fit of rage, had strangulated his wife, Rasheshori (33), on Thursday night, after coming to know that she was living with HIV/AIDS. A resident of Yainganagpokpi, Ibomcha has been living at his wife's native village, Saijang in Imphal East, for the last few years. 
  ,
  ,He said Rasheshori was married to another man before him and she had two children from her first marriage. He added her first husband died of AIDS. Notwithstanding Ibomcha's allegations, there has been no official confirmation that the deceased woman had contracted the dreaded virus. Incidentally, Rasheshori was Ibomcha's second wife as he was separated from his first wife; he has five children from his first marriage.
  ,
  ,Despite Ibomcha's confession, Sagang locals strongly feel Rasheshori was killed by her own brother, Milan, over a land issue. Ibomcha is currently lodged in the custody of the , station. He said his wife never disclosed that she was HIV positive though they were married for four years. He added she had a child in the marriage, but it died when it was just four months old, driving Ibomcha to become suspicious about his wife's health condition.
  ,
  ,Ibomcha said he recently found Rasheshori's medical reports and as he can't read, he asked a local person to go through them and got to know that his wife was HIV positive. Since his discovery, he was living with the dreaded apprehension that he, too, must have contracted the deadly virus from her, Ibomcha added. He revealed he had a heated argument on the matter with Rasheshori on Thursday night. Ibomcha claimed his pent-up anger gave way to violence and he strangulated her; he also disclosed he was drunk at the time.

  KOLKATA: Unicef, in association with , with HIV/AIDS (BNP), has conducted a mapping of HIV positive children in the state. According to the study, a whopping 83% of the children covered inherited the deadly disease from their mothers while the rest were infected through blood transfusion.
  
  ,""There is a need to prevent transmission of HIV from mother with appropriate intervention. Our focus should be to reach out to the unreachable so that the follow up is universal,"" said Dr Ivonne Camaroni of Unicef India's chief HIV section.
  ,The two-year study covered 18 districts across the state and mapped 1,639 children from 995 families where either of the parents or both are HIV positive. Of them, 857 children were found infected with the virus. North 24-Parganas topped the list with 124 infected children, followed by South 24-Parganas, with 78 children, while 72 were traced in Kolkata.
  ,
  ,As many as 65% of the mothers covered in the study did not receive prevention on parent-to-child transmission services during their late stages of pregnancy. Only 16% of the infected children are on anti-retroviral treatment while 75% of them live in areas from where they have to travel at least 100 kilometres to access healthcare facilities.

  NEW DELHI: The rate of new HIV infections fell by more than 50 per cent in India between 2001 and 2009, double of the average decline in the world, according to a new report released on Friday by , which said the global response to AIDS is showing results. 
  
  ,""In India, the rate of new HIV infections fell by more than 50 per cent and in South Africa by more than 35 per cent; both countries have the largest number of people living with HIV on their continents,"" according to 'AIDS at 30: Nations at the Crossroads' study. 
  ,
  ,The Joint United Nations Programme on , (UNAIDS) report said the global rate of new HIV infections declined by nearly 25 per cent between 2001 and 2009. 
  ,
  ,As the world marks 30 years of AIDS, UNAIDS estimates about 34 million people are living with HIV and nearly 30 million people have died of AIDS-related causes since the first case of AIDS was reported on June 5, 1981. 
  ,
  ,It said about 6.6 million people were receiving antiretroviral therapy in low and middle-income countries at the end of 2010, a nearly 22-fold increase since 2001. 
  ,
  ,A record 1.4 million people started life-saving treatment in 2010 -- more than any year before. According to the report, at least 4,20,000 children were receiving antiretroviral therapy at the end of 2010, a more than 50 per cent increase since 2008. 
  ,
  ,""Access to treatment will transform the AIDS response in the next decade. We must invest in accelerating access and finding new treatment options,"" said Michel Sidibe, UNAIDS executive director. 
  ,
  ,The report found that in the third decade of the epidemic, people were starting to adopt safer sexual behaviours, reflecting the impact of HIV prevention and awareness efforts. However, there are still important gaps. 
  ,
  ,Young men are more likely to be informed about HIV prevention than young women. Recent demographic health surveys found that an estimated 74 per cent of young men know that condoms are effective in preventing HIV infection, compared to just 49 per cent of young women. 
  ,
  ,In recent years, there has been significant progress in preventing new HIV infections among children as increasing numbers of pregnant women living with HIV have gained access to antiretroviral prophylaxis during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. The number of children newly infected with HIV in 2009 was 26 per cent lower than in 2001. 
  ,
  ,About 115 low and middle-income countries are providing optimal treatment regimens for pregnant women living with HIV as recommended by the , (WHO). 
  ,
  ,The report, however, said despite expanded access to antiretroviral therapy, a major treatment gap remains. 
  ,
  ,At the end of 2010, nine million people who were eligible for treatment did not have access. Treatment access for children is lower than for adults. 
  ,
  ,While the rate of new HIV infections has declined globally, the total number of HIV infections remains high, at about 7000 per day. The global reduction in the rate of new HIV infections hides regional variations. 
  ,
  ,According to the report, above-average declines in new HIV infections were recorded in sub-Saharan Africa and in South-East Asia, while Latin America and the Caribbean experienced more modest reductions of less than 25 per cent. 
  ,
  ,There has been an increase in rate of new HIV infections in Eastern Europe and in the Middle East and North Africa. 
  ,
  ,According to the report, gender inequalities remain a major barrier to effective HIV responses. HIV is the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age, and more than a quarter (26 per cent) of all new global HIV infections are among young women aged 15-24.

  ,A technical team from the JSACS took samples from the people of 5,480 families of the Bishnugarh block of Hazaribag between April 2008 and May 2011, and found as many as 266 people were infected with the virus.
  ,
  ,Patnaik said under the annual surveillance conducted by the Union health ministry, Bishungarh block of Hazaribag was identified as a high risk group site and widespread survey was conducted by the society. 
  ,
  ,Given the startling figures, the JSACS has opened a special cell on the block hospital premises to test blood samples and also to create awareness among people against HIV and its prevention.
  ,
  ,A large number of residents of this block, mostly drivers and labourers, migrate to big cities like Mumbai, Ahmedabad and its surrounding areas in search of employment. Normally, the labourers keep their families in their native places and develop unprotected sexual relationship with women suffering from HIV. When they come home during festivals and cultivation time, infect their wives vis-a-vis families with the virus. Residents said the number of deaths were higher than the official figures as the JSACS team has not visited many remote and Maoistprone areas like Kargalo, Purnata, Telanidah Saapmar More in Narki Panchayat.

  JAIPUR: The Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (,) has started a programme to sensitise policemen against taking punitive action against sex workers as it would result in them moving to more places, further spreading the disease.
  
  ,If the sex workers are scattered to more places, it would become difficult for RSACS to trace them and provide treatment for ,. Hence, the RSACS has sought the help of the state police in fighting HIV/AIDS. The NGO has started training 1,400 state police officials to spread the message to 80,000 policemen. The state police have decided to include the programme in their training curriculum.
  ,
  ,Additional director general of police (training) Sudhir Pratap Singh said, “We want our policemen well informed about HIV/AIDS. Such training would not only educate our policemen but would also make others aware of it. So we have decided to include it in our curriculum.”
  ,
  ,The society has been training police instructors for the past two months. It has plans to initiate trainint at all the seven police training centres which include Rajasthan Police Academy in Jaipur, Police Motor Driving School in Bikaner, police training schools in Kherwara (Udaipur), Kishangarh and Jhalawar. Also, they would provide training at Rajasthan Police Training Centre and police training school in Jodhpur.
  ,
  ,Director, AIDS project Dr Pradeep Kumar Sarda said, “The female sex workers are vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. Due to strict police action, the sex workers move to other places. This increases the risk of spreading of virus to other places. So now we have got the support of the police and we are jointly trying to uproot HIV/AIDS in the state.”
  ,
  ,This is for the first time that the police of the state are being sensitised about HIV/AIDS in such a large scale. RSACS project officer Ashish Verma said, “So far, we have provided training to more than 400 policemen. By August, we plan to train 1,400. They will train 80,000 policemen of the state.”
  ,
  ,He said the Centre has directed that the National AIDS control programme should not only be the responsibility of the health department but that of all government departments.

  ,
  ,Taking a note of this, chief medical officer (CMO), , constituted a probe in the case. 
  ,The committee however could not scan the records of government blood bank, the only blood bank in Sultanpur. “The team was busy checking details and records of the nursing homes in question,” said Dr Mishra adding that the final report is expected by Wednesday. The officer agreed that there was no other source for blood units in the city. 
  ,
  ,So, why is the probe team focusing on nursing homes and not the blood bank? Answering this he said, “We are trying to get details from all the ends and nursing homes are a crucial link.”
  ,
  ,Meanwhile, show cause notices were issued to private nursing homes, where Durga was admitted. Citing preliminary report, he said that the nursing homes were not keeping proper records. Besides this, name of doctors mentioned on admission ticket were not present. They also found that Durga was not attended by a female doctor which is another violation of the laid down rules. “Procedural irregularities at the nursing homes have made it difficult to trace the source of blood transfused to the patient.”
  ,
  ,The CMO has also written to the anti retroviral therapy centre at Chhatrapati Shahuji , (,) to find out the possibilities of getting HIV infection from contaminated blood or blood products. Head of the ART centre, Prof AK Tripathi in this regard said, “Transfusing contaminated blood means 100 % chances of getting the infection. Presence of the virus can be confirmed from the lymph nodes with 4-5 hours and from the blood stream in 3-4 days.”

  NEW DELHI: Now, employment for , patients enjoys the prime minister's backing.
  
  ,On Monday, Prime Minister Dr , officially called for linking the country's HIV programmes and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme to help HIV patients get employment.
  ,
  ,In India, social stigma against HIV patients is tremendous, making it hard for the afflicted to get work.
  ,
  ,Urging ministries to have a ""HIV sensitive"" policy and programmes so that the marginalized populations infected and affected by HIV/AIDS are not denied the benefits of these schemes, Singh, while inaugurating the national convention of zilla parishad and mayors on HIV/AIDS, said, ""We have to ensure that there is no stigma and discrimination towards HIV infected and affected persons. No child should be denied admission in schools and colleges because he or she is afflicted with HIV or because his or her parents are afflicted with this disease.""
  ,
  ,He added, ""We must ensure that no person loses his or her employment because of HIV. We must see that there is no social ostracization. We should ensure that women are not doubly stigmatized.""
  ,
  ,Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad too stressed on ending stigma against HIV patients. Azad said ""stigma associated with HIV/AIDS is a barrier for accessing services and also pushes the epidemic underground. We are committed to fight this stigma so that people living with HIV can live lives of dignity and get access to education, employment as well as health care without discrimination.""
  ,
  ,Azad said the government recently adopted a national policy to ensure a stigma-free environment in workplaces and enhance linkages to services.
  ,
  ,India is estimated to have nearly 24 lakh HIV patients. Though the adult prevalence is just 0.31%, the nation has the third highest burden of HIV, next to South Africa and Nigeria in terms of the number of people infected.
  ,
  ,The number of new HIV infections in India has come down to 1.2 lakhs annually as compared to 2.7 lakhs in 2000.
  ,
  ,""This means that in the last decade we have brought down the new infections by half,"" the minister added.
  ,
  ,One area of concern, according to Azad, is the prevention of transmission of HIV infection from infected mother to child.
  ,
  ,""Since this is a preventable phenomenon, we have to work towards elimination of this mode of transmission. However, there are major challenges in reaching out to all pregnant women for ensuring institutional deliveries for all the 27 million pregnancies that happen annually,"" he said.
  ,
  ,He added, ""To meet this challenge, on June 1, 2011, a new initiative called Janani-Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK) was launched to promote institutional deliveries. Over and above the cash incentives paid for institutional deliveries at government health facilities, this scheme includes free hospitalization, free medicines, free consumables, free diagnostics, free diet (up-to three days in the case of normal delivery and seven days in the case of Caesarean section), free provision of blood and free transport to & fro from home to all pregnant women and their new born.""

This will reduce the risk of HIV transmission through needle-syringe route as those taking the shots tend to share needle and syringe, Dr Nath told TOI.
  ,
  ,To start with, the AIDS control body will open three opiod substitution therapy (OST) centres, meant to give the oral drugs, in SCB Medical College, Cuttack besides Puri and Bargarh district headquarters hospitals. A doctor, a nurse and an outreach worker will be stationed in each of these centres.
  ,
  ,The OST centres will also counsel the users to reduce intake of drugs so they can quit gradually. It is easier to quit buprenorphine, a tablet which the users keep below their tongue, Dr Nath said.
  ,
  ,The three areas were selected in the first phase because of a sizeable number of injecting drug users in these towns, the doctor said. Over 300 persons have been found to habitually inject drugs in Cuttack, 250 in Puri and 250 in Bargarh. The three centres should open by September-October, Nath said.

  PUNE: Following the success of the initiative last year, city-based NGOs, Wake Up Pune, Santulan and Deep Griha's DISHA project, will host Melava+, a matrimonial event for the people living with HIV on August 7. With participants registering from far off places, including Delhi, the event promises to be much bigger than last year.
  
  ,Though people living with HIV can live a full and healthy life with the help of ART medications, they often have trouble finding partners. As Wake Up Pune coordinator , explained, ""not many resources are available to help people with HIV find a spouse. At times, even finding friends or community can be difficult. Wake Up Pune hopes to facilitate new and meaningful relationships for such people.""

  KOLKATA: It is wobbly with a crooked , and a depressed piston. The tip looks blunt, the cap is loose and the tube has a pale exterior. ‘For single use only’, says the instruction printed on the syringe but it looks far from a fresh one, safe enough for use. And it is not the only one which doctors at SSKM Hospital in Kolkata suspect to have been recycled from , that are routinely dumped in the hospital backyard. 
  
  ,Hundreds of syringes, saline bottles, blood bags, slides and other , — all recycled — are believed to have infiltrated SSKM through a network that has been active for some years. The result could be disastrous and might have started taking effect already, fear doctors. 
  ,
  ,TOI got hold of a syringe bearing lot number 11071 bought by the hospital in June. Tightly wrapped in a transparent packet, it looks like any other syringe. But, the piston is unsteady and loose while the needle is blunt. “It is clear that this is a recycled product and could be carrying deadly germs. Hepatitis B is the most common virus that recycled instruments like these could be carrying. Even HIV can’t be ruled out,” said Rezaul Karim, a senior faculty at the hospital. 
  ,
  ,The recycled syringes are mixed up with new ones in a batch. “It’s a fifty-fifty mix so you don’t know what you are going to get,” said a doctor. Ironically, the genuine ones were priced lower — at Rs 7 per piece — as against the recycled variety that cost Rs 7.10. It’s not just syringes that are being recycled. Slides for collecting blood samples are regularly found to have been used before. The stains on recycled slides are a giveaway but they are not easy to spot. But doctors don’t fail to notice them. “Blood reports are likely to be inaccurate if these slides are used. We often advise patients to get slides from College Street instead of buying them from shops around the hospital,” said Karim. 
  ,
  ,SSKM authorities admit to an inefficient disposal system. The waste is dumped in an open space behind the superintendent’s office and remains uncollected till 11am. “We do try and put them into three separate bags as per the norm. The agency which collects the waste is at fault as well. They don’t collect the waste in time,” said Provash Chakrabarty, medical superintendent of the hospital. The waste is taken to Dhapa where they are sold at slums on the city’s Basanti Expressway and Tangra-Topsia Road, off EM Bypass. Here, the reusable parts are segregated and sent to fringe areas like Mahishbathan, Dum Dum and Garia for cleaning. From there, the recycled wastes make their way to the “manufacturing” units at Burrabazar where they are repackaged and sold back to retailers.

  SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. : The , is drastically cutting funding for , treatment and prevention in the Asian American Pacific Islander community and has allocated no money to stem the spread of the virus in Asian American women whose rates of HIV infections are on the rise.
  
  ,Over the past four years, Asian Americans have had the highest increase in new HIV infections, going up from six percent to 10.3 percent. ""Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that the HIV infection rate in A&PI communities will surpass that of Latinos by 2015 and of African Americans by 2020 if left unchecked,"" said Tri Do, an assistant adjunct professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, in an earlier story.
  ,
  , Only 10 percent of , men and less than one percent of Asian American women have been tested for the HIV virus.
  ,
  ,San Francisco annually awards $9.7 million in funding to organizations within the city that work on HIV treatment and prevention. But the city is rolling out a new plan for prevention – known as New Directions – which primarily funds organizations working with Caucasian, African American and Latino gay men, according to API community advocates.
  ,
  , ""Trikone is saddened by the San Francisco Public Health Department's decision to slash funding for HIV/AIDS programs affecting the API community,"" Harsha Mallajosyula, advocacy director for Trikone – an organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people – said.
  ,
  ,""Surveys have consistently shown that the API community is one of the most vulnerable communities to new HIV infections and these budget cuts will only curtail the testing and awareness efforts taking place in earnest,"" he added.
  ,
  ,""Allocating resources should correlate with consistent data that places API community in high risk category and not on how visible our community is. The department's decision clearly implies that our struggles - as the API community - do not matter,"" stated Mallajosyula.
  ,
  ,The SFDPH has cut its entire annual allocation of $350,000 to the Asian and Pacific Islander Wellness Center, which claims to be the only organization in San Francisco working on HIV prevention with the API community.
  ,
  ,""We've been funded by the City for 25 years,"" Lina Sheth, director of community development and external affairs at the A&PI Wellness Center, told India-West, adding that the organization would have to cut out its youth programs and drastically reduce its services to gay and bisexual men. The Wellness Center operates on an annual budget of $3.5 million, from federal funding and private grants and donations.
  ,
  ,The organization also does not have funding to provide direct HIV prevention to Asian American women in San Francisco. ""In the New Directions program, women are completely excluded,"" stated Sheth, noting that API women tend to get tested at very late stages, when they already have AIDS.
  ,
  ,""As a community, we are very family-oriented, and the stigma of having AIDS is so deep, we wouldn't want to dishonor our family by saying we have it,"" said Sheth, explaining why more APIs do not get tested for the virus.
  ,
  ,The Indian American community needs ""culturally competent"" organizations to provide HIV prevention services.
  ,
  ,But Grant Colfax, director of the HIV Prevention and Research Section in the San Francisco Department of Public Health AIDS Office, said the City would ensure that APIs received HIV prevention. ""They have not been cut out of the budget,"" he told India-West.
  ,
  ,The New Directions program has allocated funds proportionately within ethnicities, dedicating the biggest allotment to high-risk groups, said Colfax.
  , 
  ,According to data from the SFDPH, Caucasian, African American and Latino gay males are at the highest risk for acquiring new HIV infections, along with transgendered men and intravenous drug users. Asian Americans represented 11 percent of all new HIV infections in 2010, and 8.7 percent of people living with AIDS.
  ,
  ,Colfax said his budget was based on AIDS data for 2010, and added that 8.7 percent of funding – roughly $844,000 – would be allocated to organizations working on HIV prevention in the API community.
  ,
  ,Asked to name such organizations, Colfax pointed to Magnet, an organization for gay men which offers free sexual health services, including HIV testing. Magnet, however, has no APIs on its staff or advisory board and its Web site featured no Asian American men.
  ,
  ,There is no evidence of an increase in HIV infections among Asian American women in San Francisco, stated Colfax, adding that the SFDPH is working to make HIV testing a routine part of health care screenings.
  ,
  ,In an Aug. 1 meeting with several lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender organizations, Colfax acknowledged that APIs were a ""gap population"" and promised to look at additional options for HIV prevention for Asian Americans.

  ,""We provide the drugs free of cost to around 55 to 60 patients on designated two days in a week. Patients need to take these drugs every day,"" said a staff at the ART centre at BJMC. 
  ,
  ,The hospital had to supply 3,000 tablets of retonovir, a second line ART drug, to a government medical college in Bangalore a few days ago and the supplied number of tablets were not replenished in time, resulting in short-supply, said the staff. 
  ,
  ,As a result, patients visiting the centre have been going empty-handed. ""The shortage has forced us to buy the medicine in the open market. These drugs are very expensive. Many of us have stopped the life-saving drugs due to the expensess involved,"" said a HIV patient.
  ,
  ,ART is a combination of highly advanced drugs meant to fight HIV infection and increase life expectancy. If the first line of treatment is not adequate to bring down the viral load, patients are given the second line of drugs. Both these regimens are provided free of cost by the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), the country's nodal agency for prevention and control of HIV/AIDS.

  ,National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) is supposed to fund these centres. In the two states, this is done by routing the money through Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT). Since April though, no money has come from NACO and despite many efforts, officials have not responded to NGOs and social workers associated with the centres. This has put a question mark on the future of 66 centres in both states.

  ,Many organizations running the CCCs have been spending their own money since the last few months and are no longer in a position to continue doing so. The centres provide anti-retroviral therapy to patients with provision for attending to in-patients as well as out-patients along with counselling.
  ,
  ,The first centre to provide these services in Pune's Sai Sneha Hospital has closed down. ""Ours is not a very big NGO so not much funds are available with us.

We don't have enough funds with us for all as each centre needs at least Rs 1 lakh per month,"" Dr Mrunal Shetye, project director of KHPT in Maharashtra, said. ""We are in constant touch with NACO and are trying to resolve the issue at the earliest to prevent more centres from closing down,"" he added. He did not elaborate on what the issue holding back the funds was.

When the contract ended, there was no communication from NACO about discontinuing the arrangement, but the contract has not been renewed,"" informed Datta Patil, executive director of Youth for Unity & Voluntary Action (YUVA), that runs one such centre in the city.

  ,The 17 new bNAbs were isolated from four HIV-positive individuals that are mostly of African descent. Earlier in 2009, this same research team had found two potent bNAbs, PG9 and PG16.
  ,
  ,Dennis Burton, director of the ,, said, ""Most antiviral vaccines depend on stimulating the antibody response to work effectively. Because of HIV's remarkable variability, an effective HIV vaccine will probably have to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies. This is why we expect that these new antibodies will prove to be valuable assets in the field of AIDS vaccine research.""
  ,
  ,Experts say a vaccine against HIV is a must with 7,000 new HIV infections occurring daily and 9 million HIV-infected individuals unable to access life-saving antiretroviral medication.
  ,
  ,The new bNAbs are encouraging. Many of them bind to unknown molecular structures on the surface of HIV. This means that they could significantly broaden the target options researchers have in designing vaccines to elicit similar antibodies.
  ,
  ,Since HIV was first identified in 1981, 40 millions have been infected with the virus. Annually, an estimated four million new infections occur, of which 90% are in developing countries. Over the last 25 years, AIDS has claimed more than 25 million lives.
  ,It is widely believed that to prevent HIV infection, an AIDS vaccine would need to teach the body to produce these powerful antibodies before exposure to the virus.

  ,Amulbabu was arrested by the , in 2008 on charges of wrongful restraint, causing hurt with weapons, robbery and criminal intimidation. After being lodged in the Vellore Central Prison, he was shifted to Cuddalore prison on July 14, 2009. The prison authorities claimed on August 4, 2009 Amulbabu dashed against a prison wall and inflicted injuries on himself. The same day he was declared dead. The government then ordered an RDO probe. 
  ,
  ,Meanwhile, Amulbabu’s father T Palani, a resident of Patalam near Chennai, approached the Madras high court through his counsel P Pugalenthi, seeking compensation from the state besides registration of murder case against the prison officers.
  ,
  ,On Tuesday, when the matter came up before Justice D Hariparanthaman, details of the inquiry report as also the government order initiating criminal as well as departmental proceedings against the delinquent personnel were submitted. 
  ,
  ,As per the GO dated August 5, 2011, the prison’s version of Amulbabu’s death was strongly disbelieved by the RDO, who concluded that there was little possibility that a person could inflict such serious injuries on himself while committing suicide. It also pointed out that the death must have occurred at least 12 to 24 hours before the postmortem.
  ,
  ,Passing strictures against the personnel on duty between 12 and 24 hours before the incident, the RDO also recommended criminal as well as departmental proceedings against 12 persons – eight prison warders, of whom one is no more; deputy jailor Sekar, assistant jailor Jayaraman and two members of the search party. The GO directed the district collector to initiate criminal proceedings and asked the additional DGP (prison) to initiate departmental proceedings against them.
  ,
  ,According to prison officers, of all these prison personnel, only one prison warder – Gopal – was on duty at the block where the incident occurred. He, however, died on October 1, 2009. Other personnel were on security duty at different parts of the prison premises, they claimed.

  ,
  ,Rajasthan’s Sriganganagar is in category A, while Alwar, Ajmer, Tonk, Udaipur and Barmer are in the category B in terms of risks and prevalence.
  ,
  ,Category A districts are those which have more than 1% pregnant women suffering HIV/AIDS. Category B stands for districts which have less than 1% prevalence and with more than 5% prevalence in any high risk groups (such as truckers and mine workers). 
  ,
  ,The high risk groups include female sex workers, homosexuals and injection drug users. These districts require priority attention.
  ,
  ,WHO’s regional advisor Dr Iyanthi Abeywicrame said, “There are many factors which makes Rajasthan a high risk state. 
  ,
  ,The reasons include, people from Rajasthan migrate to high prevalence states like Maharashtra and Gujarat and return with the disease. Another reason is that there are 19% of all mines in India, employing over 5 lakh workers, most of them migrants. Also, every day 25,000 truckers travel through Rajasthan. The truckers have high prevalence of HIV.”

Also, given the large population of Rajasthan, 68 million, even a small increase in HIV would translate into a large number of cases. Illiteracy is another reason of high risk.”

  RAJKOT: Twenty thalassemic children from Junagadh have tested , in the last one year, thanks to the transfusion of infected blood. They are among 100 thalassemic children from Junagadh district who have been coming to the civil hospital there for blood transfusion regularly. The patients arrange for the blood and the hospital merely does the transfusion.
  
  ,Thalassemia is a blood disorder passed down through families (inherited) in which the body makes an abnormal form of haemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. The disorder results in excessive destruction of red blood cells, which leads to anaemia. Hence, thalassemics need regular blood transfusions to stay alive. There about more than 4,500 thalassemic children in the state.
  ,
  ,“For the last one year, we have been conducting various medical tests on children who visit our centre for blood transfusion and 20 of them have turned out to be HIV positive,’’ said paediatrician Nilesh Baraiya.
  ,
  ,Doctors at , say that relatives of thalassemic patients bring blood from blood banks and the transfusion is done at the hospital. “Blood banks screen for HIV but many times, if the blood donor is in the ‘window period’, it is difficult to detect the HIV virus and the risk remains,’’ said a doctor.

  ,Through this regional strategy, , urged member countries to achieve universal access to comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment and care and to contribute to health- related millennium development goals (MDGs), particularly MDG 6 (combating ,, , and other diseases). To ensure this, primary healthcare needs to be revitalised, and health services integrated to strengthen links between HIV, TB, sexual, reproductive health and maternal and child health. The goals are guided by principles that include tackling the social determinants of health that drive the epidemic and also hinder the response; protecting human rights and promoting gender equality; and integrating HIV and other health services.
  ,
  ,A WHO official said countries must prioritise advocacy for reducing drug prices, train and sensitise health workers and minimise HIV-related stigma in healthcare settings. HIV testing and counselling needs to be decentralised to enable people to know their HIV status.
  ,
  ,The goals of the regional strategy are to achieve universal access to comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment and care. The second goal is to contribute to the achievement of millennium development goal 6 (combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases) and other health-related goals (MDGs 3, 4, 5 and 8) and associated targets.
  ,WHO has four strategic directions to achieve the goals, one is to optimise HIV prevention, care and treatment. This includes preventing sexual transmission of HIV, eliminating congenital syphilis, access to safe blood transfusion, comprehensive and integrated services for sex workers, homosexuals, people who use drugs, young, displaced, mobile and migrant populations. 
  ,
  ,The second direction is to strengthen strategic information systems for HIV research, as information on the various aspects of the issue is crucial in guiding policy and decision-making. The third is to strengthening health systems so that HIV services are part of other essential services that are available, accessible and affordable. The fourth direction is creating a supportive environment to ensure that everyone has equitable access to HIV services.

"Updated: Sep 18, 2011, 06:00 IST",Govt leaves kids with HIV in the lurch: Study,"
  NEW DELHI: They live the nightmare everyday, suffering the stigma of being ,. Little hearts, but sunk by an overwhelming thought that death may strike early. They live in the shadows and prefer anonymity for fear of discrimination. And those who go to school are often ostracized. Nor do they get specialized treatment despite massive funds being pumped for HIV care. What’s shocking is that their numbers are in thousands in Delhi. The city has at least 11,333 children infected with HIV. Most of them, nearly 2000, are concentrated in south Delhi and around 1,700 in the New Delhi area. Others are scattered across the city. 
  
  ,The plight of these children has been highlighted in a study commissioned by the , (DCPCR). The report states that the nine anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centres are not wellequipped and HIV-infected kids are yet to receive benefits of any government scheme. DCPCR has now sent its recommendations to the Delhi government for rehabilitation of these children. A potent anti-retroviral regimen helps suppress the HIV virus and preserves normal immune response in children. 
  ,
  ,The study was carried out by ARADHYA (Action for Resource Development in Health-Education by Youth Association) over a period of four months — starting March this year. The objective was to map children infected by HIV. Volunteers collected data from the Delhi State AIDS Control Society, ART centres, integrated counseling centres, blood banks, private doctors, counsellors and related agencies to find out the number of HIV patients in the city. Since many cases go unreported, the actual number may be much higher. The report also mentions there are 68,369 HIV-infected persons in the age-group of 14-24 . 
  ,
  ,“We received complaints about discrimination of HIVinfected children in schools. It was then that we decided to collect data on these children. There are at least 77,000 kids below 14 years of age in the country who are HIV-infected . Over 11,000 are in Delhi alone,” said M M Vidyarthi, member, DCPCR. 
  ,
  ,He also said most kids contract HIV from their mothers. Many of those registered for treatment hail from migrant families. Since many of them don’t have identity or residential proofs, they lose out on welfare schemes. HIV-infected kids orphaned by AIDS do not even have a means of livelihood. 
  ,
  ,“Though most parents are sensitive towards their children , they don’t put them through institutional medical care for fear of discrimination ,” he said. The study also states “there are no proper shelters for these kids and they also miss out on schemes for specialized care. Also, the schools are not sensitized enough to provide psychological support to combat trauma .” The focus group carrying out the study also met various families and found that the fare concession while travelling to ART centres promised to HIV-infected by , in 2008 are difficult to avail because of government red-tape . 
  ,
  ,DCPCR chairperson Amod Kanth said, “We have sent our recommendations and plan of action to the Delhi government for rehabilitation of these children.” These recommendations include setting up more state-run sponsorship programmes for HIV-positive children for primary and higher education, hostel facilities for infected children, separate schemes for HIV-positive widows, better access to welfare schemes and effective implementation of schemes.

Also, the quality of such tests are under scrutiny. What if the person harms himself after finding himself HIV positive but he is actually HIV negative?”, , Around 8,000 centres across India counsel people who undertake a HIV test. In 2010, an estimated 6 million people got tested for HIV. “Counselling is vital. We tell those who get tested and are found HIV positive how to lead a healthy life, how we will connect them to care, support and treatment services, put them on nutritional support and prevent further spread of the virus. In case they are found negative, they are counselled on how to stay that way and about safe sex,” the official said., , However, the UNAIDS report 2011 talks about self-testing. “Despite the advances in technology, testing is still approached with fear, accessing clinics is inconvenient and the experience of HIV testing is often stigmatizing,” the report said., , “A recent national study in Kenya showed only 16% of HIV-infected adults knew that they were infected. A variety of tests, from finger pricks to mouth swabs, can now produce results in 1–20 minutes. The cost of these tests is now measured in cents,” the report added., , One model, according to UNAIDS, has estimated that up to half of new HIV infections among children are caused by stigma, because women refuse to take tests or fail to collect their results. “One option to radically shift test access is self-testing at home. Information and support could be provided remotely. Most importantly, those who tested positive would need a clear access path to health care, starting with a confirmatory test. In September 2011, the United Kingdom’s House of Lords’ select committee on AIDS recommended repealing laws that prohibit home HIV testing,” the report said.

, This round was the last time that India could have received “free money to fund its health projects. That’s because earlier the Global Fund categorized us as a low-income country. Now, we are entering the bracket as a middle-income country and will no more be eligible for funding from them,” a , ministry official said. 
,
, He added, “What will be worst affected is the HIV programme. We spent most of our funds on prevention (70%) and the rest (30%) on treatment. But if we don’t receive money from Global Fund, we will have to cut down on our prevention strategies. We won’t be able to bring down new HIV cases,” the official added. 
,

Lending credibility to this is a study published in the Journal of American Medical Association in 1997 by a researcher from Pune’s National Aids Research Institute, which put the percentage of women getting HIV from their husbands at 92. 
,
, “We have to work towards a societal norm where couples insist on testing before tying the knot. Of course, making testing legal is not an option,” Devkar said. This year, 2,027 pregnant women in the rest of Maharashtra and 385 in Mumbai tested positive for HIV. Over the years, the number in the state has gone down: from 4,783 in 2006, to 4,552, 4,162, 3,724 and 3,361 in subsequent years. This year, the number is 2,412 (till October). But the number is still around 3,000. “That means the birth of at least 2,000 HIV-positive children. That is how high the probability of a child getting the infection from the mother is,” said Devkar.

Kurla resident Ananda (38; name changed) said: “I have faced the stigma of living with HIV for 11 years. My husband passed away a few years ago. I was ostracized by my in-laws to the extent that they did not allow me to meet my son for two years. I got his custody only after my mother-in-law died. Both I and my child would have been spared such a horrible life had pre-marital testing been mandatory.”

However, mothers infected with pure HIV-2 can pass on the infection to their newborns. ""Presently, we have nothing very effective to deal with that,"" said a Naco official who did not wish to be named.

Although official statistics say that out of a total of over 17,664 samples screened till date, only about 80 cases were positive, a little more than 10 were full-blown AIDS cases and a few deaths wer e reported, this could be the tip of the iceberg. 

, In fact, there is also a feeling that the state government is still denying that AIDS is an ‘issue’ in the state. Only the families of people who have suffered from AIDS and felt the pain and trauma related to the disease seem to understand that the disease poses a big threat. 
,
, A rapid assessment survey conducted by the , International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP), the Regional Office for South Asia (ROSA) a few years ago suggested that out of some 320 sample of drug users interviewed in Shillong, 11%, i.e. 36 were female. Only a small number out of those surveyed indicated that they were at risk of acquiring and transmitting the HIV virus, the survey report said, adding the majority perceived no possibility of contacting HIV. 
,

, A total 9,18,277 people were screened for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) presence in eight major cities — Ahmedabad, Surat, Mumbai, Noida, Chennai, Kolkata, Pune and Kerela. 
,
, In Gujarat, 6,170 people were screened between January 2010 and September 2011 wherein 180 people tested positive. Of those who tested positive, 47.22% were below 30 years of age. In addition, 23% people were in 30-40 years of age group. Only 16% were between 40-50 years while 12.77% were above 50 years of age. 
,
, Highest frequency was predictably in men as 64.44% of those who tasted positive were males while 34.44% were women. Only 1.12% of those detected positive were children. 
,
, Chief of lab services of Metropolis Healthcare Dr Jatinder Bhatia said, ""Globally, the incidence of HIV that was rapidly increasing between 1990 and1996 has slowly declined between 1996 and 2010. Various treatment methods and awareness programs helped in controlling the disease by creating mass awareness, educating people about safe sex and ill effects of HIV infection. As per the recent data, the incidence of HIV is maximum in younger age groups i.e. 20-30 years which is a major concern."" 
,
, Dr Bhatia said rate of positivity out of the screened tests is less than 10 % in Mumbai and Gujarat but 30 - 40% at other places especially north.

, According to latest statistics, 1563 persons are infected with , and 5694 are HIV positive, compared to 1145(AIDS cases) and 4829 (HIV positive cases) in 2010, revealed project director of state AIDS control society (SACS) Dr M K Pathak. “The graph of HIV positive cases has declined significantly due to awareness amongst people and strong advocacy and sensitization programmes in four years,” he claimed. 
,
, “During this period, 3,29,900 persons have been screened for HIV, including 1,17,179 pregnant women. It is hard to estimate how many full blown AIDS and HIV positive cases are there in the state, as the screenings undertaken are on those who volunteer as well for pregnant women to avoid infections to the child,” Dr Pathak said. 
,
, Significantly, the district of Lahaul & Spiti has not reported AIDS cases in the four-year period and districts Kangra, Hamirpur, Mandi and Bilaspur reporting most number of cases, followed by Solan, Shimla, Chamba, Kullu and Sirmaur. 
,
, The number of integrated counselling centres (ICTC) has gone up from 21 in 2007 to 49 in 2011. At present 1571 patients are undergoing treatments in the state at anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centers including those in Tanda, Hamirpur and Shimla.“The predominant cause of HIV infections in the state remains unsafe sexual relations and the incidence of infections due to contaminated syringes and blood is quite low,” he said.

, The hunt has begun to identify 100 volunteers belonging to a rare group of HIV infected patients who stay healthy for years without requiring life-saving antiretroviral treatment (ART). These antibodies in their blood are the ones that bars HIV from entering their blood cells and replicating, thereby progressing to AIDS. 
,
, Scientists say these antibodies would ultimately reveal the Achilles heel of the virus and help create the elusive vaccine. This is part of International Aids Vaccine Initiative’s (IAVI) programme called Protocol G, a global hunt for such antibodies launched in 2006. 
,
, So far, blood samples of 1,800 such HIV patients have been screened across 12 countries and 19 broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAbs) have been identified. A bNAb is an antibody capable of stopping a variety of HIV subtypes from infecting their target cells. 
,
, “Only a minority of people who are infected with HIV produce bNAbs. Although HIV is a wildly mutable virus, certain parts of it are relatively resistant to change. These parts are essential to the virus’s ability to infect, and they are the elements of HIV that bNAbs target,” experts said.

,
, IAVI’s India chief Dr Rajat Goyal told TOI that “This is a landmark project for India. We are presently identifying volunteers, who are at least 18 years, infected with HIV at least three years ago but has not received ART. By April, samples will be picked up and tested against a standard panel of HIV isolates by the end of 2012. We will then know whether there is a population of interest from whom these bNAb can be identified and characterized.” 
,
, Careful study of bNAbs is expected to reveal vulnerabilities of the different types of HIV. Most importantly, scientists expect that they can use information about how bNAbs bind to HIV to construct immunogens — the active ingredients of vaccines — that elicit similar antibodies. The more such antibodies researchers have in hand, the more clues they can get about how best to target HIV with a vaccine. 
,
, The project has tested HIV patients in ,, the UK, the US, Nigeria, South ,, ,, ,, ,, Australia and , to identify bNAbs. 
,
, HIV infects 7,100 people daily. The quest to develop an AIDS vaccine has consumed scientists for 25 years since the discovery of HIV. Scientists say HIV is the most mutable virus ever encountered. A number of different subtypes of the virus, known as clades, circulate in different regions of the world. Within those clades there is considerable variability, and, beyond that, the virus mutates furiously within the people it has infected. 
,
, Second, because no one is known to have cleared an HIV infection, scientists do not know which elements of the immune response must be engaged to control the virus — and thus are uncertain how to replicate such responses. 
,
, The immune system has a very narrow window of opportunity in which to neutralize HIV before the virus establishes a lifelong infection.

"Updated: Jan 12, 2012, 06:10 IST,Studies on the relationship between migration and HIV conducted by NACO in three popular migration corridors &... ",HIV 10 times more prevalent among migrants than general population,"NEW DELHI: Migration is fuelling India’s , epidemic. National AIDS Control Organisation’s latest figures show that besides high risk populations like sex workers, the highest burden of HIV is among , — 3.6%, which is 10 times the HIV prevalence among the general population. 

, With migration rates increasing, the prevalence will only get worse. According to the 2001 census, 30.1% of the population was considered to have migrated (314 million) — a considerable increase from 27.4% in 1991. NACO has, therefore, identified 108 railway stations – which are both source and destination of migrants travelling in search of work. These are now the focus of the country’s anti-HIV fight. 
,
, Red Ribbon Express (RRE), which chugs out of Delhi on Thursday, will stop at most of these 108 identified stations to test migrants for HIV besides carrying out counselling and spreading anti-HIV messages. During it’s year-long journey, RRE will traverse through 23 states, cover 30,000 km and stop at 162 stations. 
,
, Speaking to TOI, a NACO official said, “Migrants are one of the major focus areas this time with the RRE. Last year, RRE stopped at 152 stations and reached out to 8 million people directly. This time, around 30-40 stops will be to mainly address migrants.” 
,
, NACO has identified 122 districts with high out-migration across 11 states which are on priority for starting up community level interventions. Another 75 important transit locations have been identified across these 122 districts from where these migrants usually board long distance trains/buses to reach their destinations. 
,
, Studies on the relationship between migration and HIV conducted by NACO in three popular migration corridors — Ganjam-Surat, Darbhanga-Delhi and Azamgarh-Mumbai — threw up shocking findings. It showed that two to four times more number of informal workers had non-regular partners or visited sex workers with only 25% using condoms. Around 5% male migrants and 13% female migrants reported sexually transmitted infections, nearly double , average. 
,
, According to NACO, the risk of HIV infection for migrants seems to arise from a multitude of factors -- risky behaviour, lack of social and economic security and involvement in peer driven risk taking activities. 
,
, In a recent study by UNDP (through Population Council), the risk of HIV among migrants was reported to be 1.68 times more likely than non-migrants. Majority of migrants are also often poorly educated, with majority reporting less than five years of formal education. This contributes to limited knowledge of ,. 
,
, A study conducted in 30 villages in the northern parts of Karnataka revealed that 40% of single men and 35% of married migrant men had non-marital sexual relationships in the last 12 months. 
,
, For a long time, India has lived with the belief that migrants are at risk only at destination sites when they are away from home and their spouse. However, recent evidence proves otherwise. Returned migrants continue to fuel the epidemic since most infected migrants tend to return to source when they are sick. 
,
, A study of married men found returned migrants were 3.86 times as likely to be HIV positive as compared to active married migrant men. Among men reporting sex with a non-spousal unpaid female sex partner in the past year, only 19% of men reported consistent condom use. This impacts the , and spouses of informal workers/migrants at the source, making them vulnerable to infections from their husband. 
,
, RRE has been recognized as the world’s largest mass mobilization drive on HIV. Last year, around 80 lakh people were reached through the train and outreach activities. 
,
, Around 81,000 district resource persons were trained, 36,000 people got themselves tested for HIV and 28,000 people received general health check-up services. 
,
, Impact assessment of RRE indicated that the comprehensive knowledge of routes of HIV transmission, methods of prevention, condom use, STI prevention and treatment was significantly higher among respondents exposed to the RRE project compared to those not exposed.

The funding and the number of research papers coming out in international journals is largely insufficient and disappointing given the number of people suffering from the viral infection, they said. 

, On Saturday, at the international symposium on HIV and Infectious diseases organized by the YRG Care here, experts said there was a need for youngsters to get into basic and applied research in HIV/AIDS. ""It's been 25 years since we first diagnosed HIV in this country. But the number of research papers that have come out of our country is abysmally low,"" said Dr ,, who diagnosed the first HIV/AIDS case in the country. 
,
, Results of a global clinical trial showed that treating HIV-infected individuals with antiretrovirals - the drug of choice for people with HIV/AIDS - can reduce the risk of sexual transmission of HIV to the uninfected partner by 96%. ""India was a part of this trial. But we should have ideally been a forerunner. In most couples, only one is HIV positive. They always ask if they can have healthy babies without the virus being transmitted to the non-infected person,"" Dr Solomon said. 
,
, India has been a part of some global research like that of vaccines. So far, India has worked on at least vaccine candidates for HIV/AIDS. , AIDS Research Institute and the , in , have been involved in clinical trails and some private centres have been working on gels that can prevent transmission. ""But the number of international papers coming out of India is less than most developing countries,"" said Dr VD Ramanathan of the National Institute for Tuberculosis Research, who is part of the AIDS vaccine trial.

After releasing the 13th , XIII for 2011, experts in the field said that awareness among the public had gone up but awareness without misconception was low. 

, Many believe that healthy-looking people have a good immune system and may not test positive for HIV/AIDS. Doctors have been trying to tell people that antiretroviral drugs — the medicines of choice for HIV/AIDS — will only keep the viral load low, but many assume they are safe after taking them. “We require schemes to target misconceptions. Only awareness without misconceptions will strengthen the fight against ,,” said AIDS Prevention And Control (APAC) project director Dr Bimal Charles. 
,
, Dr Charles said that in the surveys, people had said cleaning the vagina with vinegar or having sex with monkeys would keep out the infection. 
,
, The annual survey report, by APAC project along with Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) and USAID, has been prepared since 1996. The survey is conducted among high-risk groups like female sex workers, gays and injecting drug users and bridge population groups such as truckers and migrant workers. 
,
, With a sample size of 5,000, the field work was done in November and December 2011 across 15 towns in Tamil Nadu. The results showed a significant improvement in the behaviour among targeted groups where NGOs were working. 
,
, Most field workers had reasons to smile: condom use among female sex workers had gone up from 95.7% to 98.5%; 96.1% of gays reported using condoms during sex with commercial partners, 91% of gays reported taking HIV test in the last one year; the proportion of Injecting Drug Users (IDUs) who reported sharing needles and syringes with their partners reduced from 43.3% in the last round of BSS to 31.6% in the current round; and a lesser number of truckers (28.5%) reported seeking services of commercial sex workers when compared to earlier survey (45.1%). 
,
, But there is still a need for improvement. For instance, though condom use is high among casual and regular clients, it remains low among regular partners; many counselling services aren’t adequately used; and the changing patterns of sex workers have excluded some women from the intervention programmes.

,
, Now, Landau and his colleagues are able to provide an answer: When a virus, like HIV, infects a cell, it hijacks the cell’s molecular material to replicate. That molecular material is in the form of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), which are the building blocks for ,.

The annual surveillance carried out by the National Aids Control Organisation (Naco) has pegged the prevalence at 12.5% in 2010-11 (April-March ) compared to 9.2% recorded in 2008-09 , an almost 36% jump from the base figure. 

, Though commonly MSM population is equated with gay men, activists debate that it is not so, as bisexuals—men having sex with both men and women-—too come under the gambit. 
,
, HIV prevalence among MSM in the city had seen a huge fall from 23.9% to 6% between 2000-2001 and 2005-06 . But, after that, the graph has only zoomed upwards with the prevalence going up to 7.6% in 2006-07 , to 8.6% in 2007-08 and 9.2% in 2008-09 . There was no surveillance for the year 2009-10 . 
,
, Project director of , (MDACS) Dr S S Kudalkar did not want to comment on the issue. 
,
, Project director of Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) Dr S S Kudalkar did not want to comment on the rise in prevalence of HIV among men having sex with men in the city and said he was yet to receive the detailed figures of the HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS). NACO officials , too, remained unavailable for comment. 
,
, While, the state agencies have reached out to only 39,572 MSM, NGOs accept that the number is ""grossly underreported"" . ""It is a complicated area where even gay organizations have limitations as far as reaching out is concerned. Here, we are talking about men, many of whom do not want to be identified as gay,"" said public health expert Dr Shilpa Merchant, previously associated with Population Services International. 
,
, Activists are unanimous that there are many men who regularly indulge in sexual activity with other men but resist being labelled as gay fearing social stigma. 
,
, Gay activist and chairperson of Humsafar Trust Ashok Row Kavi said that the government had managed to reach out to only networks of identified homosexuals. ""Bisexuals do not even want to come to identifiable places. This population is incredibly difficult to access ,"" he said, adding that the number of MSM population could be ""very, very high"" . 
,
, Medically, the debate has often revolved around anal sex being riskier than vaginal sex, and therefore, spouses being vulnerable of getting infected not only with HIV but other sexually transmitted diseases. But Kavi said that it would be impractical to say that only gay men indulged in such sex. ""Studies have shown that up to 45% of heterosexual married couples indulge in it, though that too is a high-risk behaviour . The idea is to educate men about safe sex,"" he said. 
,
, Kavi also said that in the course of reaching out to gay men, his NGO had observed that between 50% and 55% of men were having sex with their wives as well as other men. ""Of these, around 25% were married and did not seem to be under any pressure to indulge in such sexual behaviour,"" he said. ""Internet holds the key to reach out to MSM. We have to reach them through emails, tracking sex sites and then educate them,"" said Kavi. The internet has emerged as the most commonly used medium by men to look for ‘partners' . 
,
, Merchant said the government should think of ways to reach out to all men rather than only gay men. ""There are hardly any dedicated programmes to target this high-risk population . We need neutral organizations to participate,"" she said.

The preliminary data of the 2011 study jointly undertaken by , (NACO) and , (Apsacs) has revealed that the state witnessed a sharp decline in HIV prevalence among the high risk groups. 

, If the HIV prevalence among female sex workers was 11% in 2008, it has dropped to 7% now. The highest decline was noted among the Men having Sex with Men (MSMs) community wherein from 23%, the incidence plummeted to 10%. Among the Injectable Drug Users (IDUs), the incidence has declined from 7% to 3%.

The state has 1.56 lakh sex workers. , alone has 22,000 female sex workers and 4,000 MSMs. Apsacs officials said that the condom usage has increased considerably resulting in the decline of HIV infections. ,, joint director (targeted interventions) said that the health seeking behaviour among the high risk groups has gone up which was earlier not the case. ""This is a very positive sign,"" said Aditya.

For more than three months, patients are struggling without treatment as the first line of therapy is not effective to keep the viral load under control. 

, The problem has compounded for patients as the JJ Hospital’s Centre of Excellence remains one of the nodal centres in the state to screen and select patients for second line of anti-retroviral therapy (ART). 
,
, Patients who become resistant to the first line of ART treatment, and have a viral load of more than 5,000 copies per millilitre, have to be started on the second line. Patients are also dependant on the free second line ART treatment as it could cost about Rs 10,000 in a month. 
,
, A medical source told TOI said the problems started soon after former ART in-charge Dr Alaka Deshpande quit in November 2011. “Monthly meetings, which were held to select patients after their viral load examinations were done, just stopped. Without those meetings the patients could not be selected,” said a JJ Hospital source. 
,

The new team headed by Dr V K Joglekar has requested us to sensitize them about the ART. We will be doing that soon.” he said. Rewari also said that not more than 100 patients would be affected because of the delay. “Two centres in Aurangabad and Pune have commenced operations to take the load off the JJ Hospital staff.

"Updated: Mar 15, 2012, 14:10 IST","In India, two out five female sex workers suffering from HIV","NEW DELHI: Nearly two out of every five female sex workers (FSWs) in India could be suffering from , infection. 

, Those who aren’t already infected, however, carry more than 50-times increased risk of getting infected during their lifetime. 
,
, The region where the risk of HIV infection increased most for a sex worker was Asia (29 times more) compared to a 12-time higher threat in Africa and Latin America. 
,
, A study, conducted by Dr Stefan Baral from the Center for Public Health and Human Rights at Johns Hopkins’ ,, to be published by the Lancet on Thursday shows that FSWs in developing countries are 14 times more likely to be infected by HIV than women in the general population. 
,
, The authors carried out an analysis of 102 studies, representing almost 100,000 FSWs in 50 countries. Overall, HIV prevalence in FSWs was found to be 12%. 
,
, In 26 countries deemed to have medium or high background HIV prevalence, some 31% of FSWs were HIV- positive, and were 12 times more likely to be infected than women from the general population. 
,
, “We identified consistent evidence of substantially higher levels of HIV among FSWs compared with all women of reproductive age in low and middle-income countries in all regions with data,” the authors said. 
,
, “These findings suggest an urgent need to scale up access to quality HIV-prevention programming and services among FSWs because of their heightened burden of disease and likelihood of onward transmission through high numbers of sexual partners as clients. Improvement of linkages to antiretroviral treatment and retention in care is crucial. The role of stigma, discrimination and violence targeting female sex workers globally will be required to reduce the disproportionate disease burden among these women,” they added. 
,
, “When reviewing the data from the past five years, FSWs still carry more than a 50-time increased odds of HIV infection in India. Since HIV prevalence is a lagging indicator of prevention success, time is needed to reveal the benefit of these programmes in terms of the absolute burden of HIV among female sex workers in India. Nonetheless, the disproportionate burden of HIV among these sex workers, even in settings where progressive programmes exist, emphasizes the need to increase coverage by increasing scale of prevention programmes and decreasing barriers to access,” is how The Lancet summed about the situation in India. 
,
, In India, women account for around one million out of 2.5 million estimated number of people living with HIV/AIDS. The National , Control Organization estimates that around 4.9% of FSWs in India are HIV- positive. 
,
, The estimated number of new annual HIV infections has declined by more than 50% over the past decade. India had about 1.2 lakh new HIV infections in 2009 as against 2.7 lakh in 2000. 
,
, While this trend is evident in most states, some low prevalence states have shown an increase in the number of new infections over the past two years. Of the 1.2 lakh estimated new infections in 2009, the six high-prevalence states account for only 39% of the cases, while states like Odisha, Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat account for 41% of new infections. 
,
, The adult HIV prevalence at national level has continued its steady decline from estimated level of 0.41% in 2000 through 0.36% in 2006 to 0.31% in 2009. In India, about 40% people don’t even know their HIV status. 
,
, The prevalence of HIV among key population at higher risk of infection – notably sex workers, people who inject drugs and men who have sex with men – is high in several Asian countries. However, the virus is spreading to other sections of the population through the years.

  With the basics against , – early diagnosis and continued treatment - seemingly in place, Indian doctors are looking at sociological nuances associated with the condition. An ongoing study at JJ Hospital’s gynaecology department, for instance, is looking at fertility and reproductive desires of , people. 
  
  ,“We are studying if men and women who have been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS understand the emotional, social and financial implications of having a child,” said Dr Rekha Daver, who heads the gynaecology department. The fiveyear-long study, which is being done jointly with the Indian Council for Medical Research, started last year. The idea is to develop a better counselling mechanism for HIV-positive people. Incidentally, the National AIDS Control Organisation has recognised JJ Hospital’s gynaecology department as a Centre of Excellence in the Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission of HIV/AIDS programme. 
  ,
  ,“We have delivered 1,073 HIVpositive women in the last 11 years. We have also managed to control mother-to-child transmission of HIV to a great deal. In fact, of the last 100 deliveries, 95 children are free of the virus,’’ said Dr Daver. 
  ,
  ,Considering the number of HIVpositive people who come to ,, it’s not surprising that the fertility desire study is being done here. “The study involves hours of intense counselling, taking down notes and a check-up . We have finished interviewing around 20 people so far,’’ said Dr Daver. 
  ,
  ,She added patients usually say having a child is their ultimate dream. “Social pressure as well as the woman’s own mental makeup contributes to this decision,” said Dr Daver. Every pregnant woman who comes to JJ Hospital’s gynaecology department is counselled and voluntarily tested for HIV. They are informed of the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and possibility of the children becoming AIDS orphans. “But many still want their biological babies,” she said.
  , 
  ,A Harvard University study a few years back noted that “spousal, family, community and cultural influences greatly shape HIV-positive women’s desire to become pregnant. Studies in India , South Africa, Taiwan and Vietnam have demonstrated the weight of culture-specific spousal and family wishes that a woman will need to consider besides her own desires and HIV status.”

, This was revealed in a field survey of 401 such families in the city, undertaken by the Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics (GIPE) to gauge the economic profile of People Living with HIV (PLHIV) and the socio-economic impact of HIV at the household level. 
,
, The families surveyed are registered with a city NGO, which works towards providing socio-psycho, legal support and counselling to PLHIV. Though the study included households from all strata of society, and from varied economic backgrounds, nearly 50% of the sample group was from the lower economic categories. The study was completed under the guidance of Sanjeevanee Mulay, former associate professor at GIPE. 
,
, Varun Sharma, who undertook the study, is a former senior research fellow at GIPE and currently assistant professor at the , (IHMR) in Bangalore. He said the study was an attempt to estimate the relationship between HIV prevalence and poverty. “We cannot overlook the fact that PLHIV from the lower socio-economic background, especially from the slum areas in cities like Pune, are most vulnerable. This should be considered while drafting policies and programmes concerning HIV,” he said. 
,
, Sharma said the study used economic methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Standard of Living Index (SLI). Based on these two indices, the study found that families with HIV+ persons are more destitute compared to other families. “This is especially true of households run by HIV+ women. The study revealed that 70% of the sample households managed by women have a middle socio-economic status whereas about 50% of them can be categorised as the ‘poorest of the poor’. In comparison, only 30% of households run by men fit in the category. The reason for this may be that, in general, a woman’s income is less than that of a man,” he said. The study revealed that though anti-retroviral therapy (ART) for treating HIV is free at the public health centres, HIV+ people have to spend from their own pockets on other illnesses and ailments which come with the HIV infection, Sharma said. “The economic burden is more on those who are already poor, and it leads to medical poverty trap. In the analysis, we found that there is a sharp increase of 20% BPL headcounts, when adjusted for out-of-pocket health spending,” he said. 
,
, HIV+ people from the upper and middle socio-economic backgrounds usually opt for private health facilities, which are better, and also because it offers them a privacy. 
,
, Sharma said a comparison between the families surveyed and the city’s non-HIV urban households (surveyed under the national reproductive and child health programme) confirmed that a majority of PLHIV households either came from the lower economic strata of society or had gradually become impoverished over a period of time. According to the study, 36.9% households with HIV+ members had a low standard of living. 
,
, Sanjeevani Kulkarni, coordinator, ,, which treats more than 3,500 , patients from the city and other parts of the country at its ,, said special focus on widowed women diagnosed with HIV is needed. “Around 33% of the total population of HIV infected women belongs to this category.

The rise in condom usage has brought down the , prevalence in the state significantly among its high risk group population. 

, The 7.5 crore free condoms that were supplied for the high risk groups got exhausted much before the end of the year and the state had to request the , government to donate their leftover 60 lakh condoms in March. Seeing the massive response, the , (Naco) has added to AP’s quota of condoms and will now ship 10.9 crore condoms this year. 
,
, The authorities are attributing the substantial drop in the HIV prevalence rate to the increased condom usage. As per the survey conducted by AP State Aids Control Society (Apsacs) and Naco, that is being finalized, the HIV prevalence among female sex workers has dropped from 11% in 2008 to 7% now. The highest decline was noted among the Men having Sex with Men (MSMs) community wherein from 23%, the incidence plummeted to 10%. Among the Injectable Drug Users (IDUs), the incidence has declined from 7% to 3%. The sexually transmitted infections too have seen a drastic drop. 
,
, Officials say that till about four years ago, the situation was so dismal that lakhs of condoms were wasted, having crossed their expiry dates because of no takers. But today, Apsacs is struggling to ensure that shortages don’t crop up. “People have become more health conscious now and they are also seeking the services of the integrated counseling and testing centres. This is a healthy trend,” says T Kailashditya, joint director, targeting interventions, Apsacs. He added that Uttar Pradesh tops the country in condom usage and is followed by ,, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. 
,
, Apsacs has been selling condoms at a subsidized rate to several sections such as truckers. Last year, 1.5 crore condoms were marketed like this for this population apart from the 7.5 crore free condoms doled out to the high risk groups. “The situation is such that we have to plan a month in advance for the supply to avoid a shortage,” said the official. 
,
, Besides, condoms are being lapped up over the counters by the general population. Experts said that factors such as education, benefits of condom use and perceived infection risk are also playing an important role. They added that after five years of effort, the demand for condoms has gone up and the HIV prevalence rate has shown a decline.

, While orphaned children infected with HIV/AIDS will get Rs 2,050 per month, other children will get Rs 1,750 per month. The budget has earmarked an initial corpus of Rs 5 crore for the ambitious health scheme. This scheme was among the key highlights of Delhi government’s budget for 2012-13 in the health sector, for which Rs 2,124 crore (14.16% of the total outlay) has been allocated. 
,
, State health minister AK Walia told TOI that more than 300 beneficiaries have already been identified for the issuance of the assistance money. “There are about 10,000 HIV/ AIDS patients registered with us for anti-retroviral treatment. These patients need extra nutrition and balanced diet to cope with their compromised immune system. The financial aid is aimed at helping such patients,” said Walia. 
,
, In a relief for , patients, the government will introduce , exemption on ‘blood bags’ (lucocite filters), which will reduce the cost of blood storage and transfusion. 
,
, Expansion of the ambulance fleet, increasing the number of dialysis machines at hospitals and improving the infrastructure at Delhi State Cancer Institute were among other highlights. 
,
, However, the budget proposals for the health sector, pertaining to development of health infrastructure, can largely be described as old wine in new bottle. 
,
, It proposes to increase the number of hospital beds per thousand population in the capital from 2.55 to 3. For this, the government has said new hospitals will be constructed at Burari, Ambedkar Nagar, Hastsal and Sarita Vihar, among other places – most of these projects were mentioned in last year’s budget also.

"Updated: Jun 13, 2012, 05:44 IST",Pension remains a mirage for HIV patients,"NIZAMABAD: HIV-positive patients, who continue face discrimination from society as well as from family members, have to contend with government apathy too. The meagre Rs 200 pension, promised by the government two years ago, remains a dream for the HIV-positive patients.
 
, With a view to providing economic support to the HIV-positive patients, the government had decided to provide Rs 200 every month on a par with the physically handicapped, widows and destitutes, but the proposal remained only on paper.
, 
, Konda Lakshmi (name changed) rued the lack of financial support from the government as well as her family.
, 
, “We are left to fend for ourselves. A small gesture could have gone a long way in helping us financially,” she pointed out. Another proposal to provide free bus passes to , patients to visit , (ART) centres every month to take medicines and undergo treatment free of cost has also been a non-starter. “Patients can at least visit the ART centre to take medicines if they are provided free bus passes,” Lakshmi said.
, 
, Several HIV patients alleged that the government had washed its hands of by merely issuing ATM cards to them. “Though the cards were issued three months back, not a single penny has been transferred to our savings accounts so far,” complained another patient Sunnam Gangadhar (name changed). He also criticised the government for selecting a meagre number of patients for the pension scheme when thousands of people were afflicted with the disease in Nizamabad district.
, 
, According to statistics, there are about 12,000 registered HIV-positive patients in the district. But the district authorities have selected only 1,250 patients for the Rs-200 pension scheme. As per the health guidelines, patients whose CD4 count is less than 250 and those who take medicines from the ART centres are eligible for the pension scheme.
, 
, When contacted, district medical and health officer (DM&HO) Harinath said that there was delay in transferring the amounts to the savings accounts of the patients. S Siddaiah, who runs an NGO, demanded that the government provide essential commodities like rice, pulses, oil, sugar and others free of cost to the HIV patients.
, 
, Recalling that HIV-positive patients were supplied 30 kg rice at Rs 2 a kg every month by issuing Anthyodaya card in 2009-10, he urged the government to take measures to protect the HIV patients.

Student volunteer Max Silva, a senior in anthropology at University of Arizona, said he signed on for the programme because he wanted to do something different and help the HIV community. 
,
, “At first I thought it would be tough to teach children in Chennai and that language would be a barrier,” said Silva, one of the 19 American student-volunteers in the city this year. “But, man, we are having a blast! The kids here are fluent in English and ask you some very pertinent questions,” he added. 
,
, School students, for their part, have reacted enthusiastically to the workshops held by the volunteers. “We became aware of unprotected sex and the danger of AIDS,” said Ramesh, a Class 9 student at a school in the city. “It was not a subject that we could discuss at home or with our teachers.” 
,
, Arulraj Louis, IAPA education director, says the American students have helped the group reach out to school children and educate them on how to prevent the spread of AIDS. “They will be with us till the end of July,” he said. He said IAPA’s aim was to spread updated, accurate, fact-based HIV/AIDS information to schools and community groups. “Our focus in the volunteer programme is to provide a rewarding and enjoyable experience for American and Indian students that will encourage involvement in the fight against HIV/AIDS,” Louis said. 
,
, Every year, IAPA conducts a Summer Volunteer Programme (SVP) to teach school and university students in Chennai the scientific facts of HIV/AIDS, IAPA field officer Sheema Gopi said. “We enroll volunteers from the University of Arizona and Arizona State University and train them for six months before they come to Chennai,” she added 
,

It has been researched that truckers are a critical group. Their living and working conditions, sexually active age and separation from regular partners for extended periods of time predispose them to paid sex or sex with non-regular partners. ""These interventions build awareness among the spouses of truckers and migrant workers, women aged 15 to 49 and children affected by HIV or vulnerable population groups,"" said Dr Gupta.

"Updated: Jul 5, 2012, 05:02 IST","US upholds privacy, approves HIV test at home","NEW DELHI: Now, HIV can be tested in the privacy of your home. 

, The , (,) on Wednesday approved the first over-the-counter , that allows people to test at home to see whether they are infected with the virus that causes AIDS. 
,
, The , is designed to allow individuals to collect an oral fluid sample by swabbing the upper and lower gums inside of their mouths, then place that sample into a developer vial and obtain test results within 20-40 minutes. 
,
, However, a positive result with this test does not mean that an individual is definitely infected with HIV, but rather that additional testing should be done in a medical setting to confirm the result. 
,
, Similarly, a negative test result does not mean that an individual is definitely not infected with HIV, particularly when exposure may have been within the previous three months. 
,
, FDA says the test has the potential to identify large numbers of previously undiagnosed HIV infections, especially if used by those unlikely to use standard screening methods. 
,
, “Knowing your status is an important factor in the effort to prevent the spread of HIV,” said Karen Midthun, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “The availability of a home-use HIV test kit provides another option for individuals to get tested so that they can seek medical care, if appropriate.” 
,
, However, India is not going to allow home testing of this deadly infection. India’s National AIDS Control Organization (,) told TOI that counseling patients before and after they undergo testing is vital. 
,
, “If patients find themselves HIV positive by testing at home without counseling, it can push them to suffer from severe depression, make them commit suicide or lead to violence if women are found to be positive. Around 35% of all new cases of HIV in India are among women India. Such home testing kits can be allowed in countries with high infection rates in the general population and not in India where the epidemic is concentrated among high risk populations like sex workers,” said national ART officer at NACO Dr B B Rewari. 
,
, Union health ministry officials said at present nearly 10,000 centres across India counsel people who undertake a HIV test. In 2011, an estimated 1.6 million people got tested for HIV. Around 2.31 million people are estimated to be HIV positive in India. 
,
, “Of these, 40% don’t know that they are infected. Counseling is vital. We tell those who get tested and are found HIV positive how to lead a healthy life, how we will connect them to care, support and treatment services, put them on nutritional support and prevent further spread of the virus,” Dr Rewari added. 
,
, Dr Sandhya Kabra from NACO said, whenever a patient is found to be HIV positive, the test is repeated two more times to confirm the results. 
,
, “If found negative, the test isn’t repeated. But if the test gives a positive result, we repeat the test for extra confirmation. Testing without counseling can make a patient take drastic measures,” Dr Kabra said. 
,
, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that there are about 50,000 new HIV infections every year. Many of these new infections are transmitted from people who are unaware of their HIV status. 
,
, Clinical studies for self-testing have shown that the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test has an expected performance of 92% for test sensitivity, the percentage of results that will be positive when HIV is present. This means that one false negative result would be expected out of every 12 test results in HIV-infected individuals. 
,
, Clinical studies also have shown that the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test has an expected performance of 99.98% for test specificity, the percentage of results that will be negative when HIV is not present. 
,
, This means that one false positive would be expected out of every 5,000 test results in uninfected individuals. 
,
, A variety of home tests finger pricks or mouth swabs are now being developed to be used by individuals to know their HIV status by sitting at home which can produce results in one-20 minutes. 
,
, A , report recently said the world was opening up to home testing for HIV since fewer than half of those living with HIV knew their status. This is a huge barrier to treatment scale up. 
,
, “Despite the advances in technology, testing is still approached with fear, accessing clinics is inconvenient and the experience of HIV testing is often stigmatizing. The cost of these tests is now measured in cents,” UNAIDS said. 
,

Twenty-one NGOs (non-governmental organizations) and 13 community-based organizations (CBOs) that handle a total of 52 intervention projects for the city’s population at highest risk of contacting and spreading HIV have not received central government funds since April.
 
, This blow comes at a time when already close to 60,000 of the 4.20 lakh individuals in the state afflicted with HIV are living in the city. Although its prevalence in the general population has been on a decline, the graph has only been rising for the high-risk groups.
, 
, The crunch in funds has directly affected efforts made by agencies to protect an estimated 2.34 lakh high-risk individuals. They include , (FSW), transgender individuals, men having sex with men (MSM), intravenous drug users (IDU), truckers and migrants. Currently, HIV prevalence among FSW is as high as 27%, 18% in IDUs, 12% in MSM and 30% in the transgender population.
, 
, 
, Following the fund crisis, most NGOs and CBOs have been forced to downsize their workforce and a few have even completely stalled their work. Funds allocated to each project vary from Rs 9 lakh to 20 lakh, depending on its reach. Without the money, most organizations have been unable to pay their staffers, and have defaulted on the rents and electricity bills. The worst hit are some former sex workers-turned-outreach workers and -peer educators, who have had to go back to their old ways to support their families.
, 
, TOI came across one such outreach worker from Malwani who said she waited for two months for her salary of Rs 7,000 to arrive. “On the third month, I had no choice but to do the only work I knew,” said the worker, who is associated with a CBO that caters to the transgender population. As an outreach worker, her job is to visit brothels to distribute condoms and inform new entrants about prevention.
, 
, A Ghatkopar-based NGO told TOI that they were struggling to even purchase stationery for daily use while a south Mumbai CBO that works with MSM said they had to take huge loans to meet ends. Eldred Tellis, director of ,, said he had to borrow approximately Rs 7.5 lakh from his trust’s buffer to sustain three IDU projects. “Though bigger NGOs can sustain for a while, smaller organizations are finding it extremely difficult to cope,” he said.
, 
, Ashok Row Kavi, founder-chairperson of Humsafar Trust, also said three of his MSM projects were badly hit. “Without paying salaries, how can I expect my volunteers to be present at the site and distribute condoms everyday? This (fund crunch) has created a dent in the measures taken so far and an increase in HIV prevalence is likely,” he said.
, 
, Dr Balkrishna Adsul, additional project director of Mumbai District Aids Control Society (,), said, “The delay was from NACO’s end. But funds have arrived now and we have started disbursing it already.” He also said the crunch at the Centre could be caused by the drying up of money from global agencies. Geneva-based Global Fund (GF) had announced stoppage of funds till 2014 for diseases, including HIV, in India.
, 
, Dr Neeraj Dhingra, deputy director general, NACO, said he would check how and why the crunch happened. “There is sufficient money to fund projects as long as NGOs are clear with their records,” he said.

The drug,'Truvada' can now be used by those at high risk of the infection and anyone who may engage in sexual activity with HIV-infected partners, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced. 

, ""In two large clinical trials, daily use of the drug was shown to significantly reduce the risk of HIV infection,"" it said on Monday. However, some health workers and groups active in the HIV community opposed the approval for the once-a-day pill. 
,
, There are concerns that circulation of such a drug could engender a false sense of security and mean people will take more risks. There have also been fears that a drug-resistant strain of HIV could develop. People diagnosed with HIV that without treatment develops into AIDS take antiviral medications to control the infection that attacks their immune system. 
,
, In a statement, the FDA stressed that the drug should be used as part of a ""comprehensive HIV prevention plan"", including condom use and regular HIV testing. Studies show that Truvada reduced the risk of HIV in healthy gay men - and among HIV-negative heterosexual partners of , people - by between 44% and 73%. 
,
, ""In the 80s and early 90s, HIV was viewed as a life-threatening disease; in some parts of the world it still is.

The bacterium is commonly found in the mosquito's midgut. It was found that the modified bacteria were 98 per cent effective in reducing the malaria parasite burden in the insects, the researchers said.

, Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Bethesda, Md., made the recommendation at a JAMA media briefing at the International , Conference. 
,
, Among the most important interventions is combination antiretroviral therapy, which significantly improves the health and longevity of individuals infected with HIV. 
,
, “Since the advent of antiretroviral therapy, the annual number of deaths due to AIDS has decreased by two-thirds in the United States. Globally, an estimated 700,000 lives were saved in 2010 alone due to the increased availability of antiretroviral therapy in low- and middle-income countries,” Dr. Fauci and Gregory K. Folkers, M.S., M.P.H., also of the NIAID, wrote. 
,
, “Important challenges remain—notably finding the resources and developing the infrastructure to provide antiretroviral therapy to the estimated 8 million individuals with , infection who need these drugs but are not receiving them,” they noted. 
,
, The researchers added that antiretroviral therapy could also prevent HIV infection by reducing the amount of virus in an infected person''s blood and other body fluids, making it less likely that the virus will be transmitted to others. Also, antiretroviral therapy is highly effective in blocking mother-to-child HIV transmission. 
,
, Other important interventions include medical male circumcision, which offers a highly effective and durable way to protect heterosexual men from HIV infection; and potentially, pre-exposure prophylaxis with antiretroviral medications, which have shown promise in reducing an individual''s risk of acquiring HIV infection. 
,
, “Each of these treatment and prevention strategies has a strong evidence base; with further refinement and scale-up and also when used in combination, they could have an extraordinary effect on decreasing the trajectory of the HIV pandemic,” they said. 
,
, They said researchers are maintaining focus on 2 key scientific challenges that remain: the development of a vaccine and a cure. They wrote that modest success in a large-scale clinical trial of an HIV vaccine, promising results in animal models, and advances in structure-based vaccine design suggest that an HIV vaccine is feasible. The prospect of an HIV cure remains challenging. 
,
, The researchers concluded that ending the global HIV/AIDS pandemic “will require a global commitment of resources involving additional donor countries, strengthening health care systems overall, and fostering greater ownership by host countries of HIV/AIDS effort, including investing more in the health of their people. With collective and resolute action now and a steadfast commitment for years to come, an AIDS-free , is indeed within reach.”

 Earlier this week, the Food and , Administration approved a daily pill, Truvada, which reduces the risk of HIV infection.

, A long-acting, nanoformulated ART (nanoART) would be a substantive improvement over daily and sometimes more complex regimen of ,, lead investigator on the development of nanoART for , and professor and chairman of the department of pharmacology and experimental neuroscience (PEN) at UNMC, Howard Gendelman, MD, said.
, A journal article hails the successful testing of UNMC’s ART injectables as treatment of HIV-infected mice and in preventing new infections.
, “We actually followed the process exactly as we would with a person – and it worked,” Dr. Gendelman said.
, “This is all very exciting. Although there are clear pitfalls ahead and the medicines are not yet ready for human use, the progress is undeniable.”
, Dr. Gendelman said one of the project’s real advantages is in the nanoformulations.
, “NanoART is cell directed. So when you take a pill, the pill travels throughout the body indiscriminately. In these nanomedicines, you can use the body’s own cells to direct the medicine where you want it to go,” he said.
, The UNMC project directs the medicine to the monocyte-macrophage, cells which carry the drug particle to sites of the body specifically where HIV grows.
, “You’re using the cell that is the target for the virus to deliver the drug against the virus,” Dr. Gendelman said.
, Dr. Gendelman calls the progress made “a Nebraska invention,” as it involved so many of the state’s scientists in different disciplines working together.
, He said this marks the third article his team has had published in major biomedical journals in recent months with all the articles related to the nanomedicine injectable therapy.
, The advance to use the new nanomedicines to specifically target reservoirs for viral infection was explained by ,, Ph.D., associate professor in PEN, lead investigator, and published in the International Journal of Nanomedicine. This paper describes how these drug inventions can enter the brain and ameliorate nervous system disease.
, The third study, published in Trends in Neurosciences, is a research area led by Larisa Poluektova, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor in PEN, and the developer of the mouse models of HIV/AIDS used in study.
, “We work as a team and work effectively as a team with different scientists with very different disciplines involved in different aspects of the work,” Dr. Gendelman said.
, This research team is made up of two UNMC colleges, four departments and two universities. The drugs were developed in UNMC labs using nanoformulation approaches.
, The ART tests in mouse models were made possible by UNMC’s development of specially designed mice. Because mice cannot catch human HIV, UNMC has developed mice with the equivalent of a human immune system. Such a mouse model enables advanced tests on HIV and its treatment.
, Dr. Kanmogne said an ART injection would be an improvement for HIV patients because it would produce all the medicine needed without the complications of remembering to take pills daily, drug toxicities, buildup of viral resistance, intestinal problems, or the social stigma of pills.

She said mass awareness, universal guidelines for immunization and hygienic handling of food and water can reduce the liver disease burden substantially. 

, Menabde was speaking at the inauguration of the ‘Health Liver’ campaign by Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS), India’s first NABH accredited super specialty institute. Delhi health minister AK Walia and K Srinath Reddy, director of the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), among others, were present on the occasion. 
,
, Menabde said there are five main hepatitis viruses, types A, B, C, D and E, of which B and C are most lethal as they can lead to liver cirrhosis and cancer. She added, “About six lakh people die every year due to the acute or chronic consequences of hepatitis B, nearly 100 times more than HIV/AIDS.” 
,
, Walia said that both hepatitis B and C spread through contact with the blood of an infected person. It can be through transfusion of infected blood, sharing of contaminated needles or injection material. Hepatitis B can also be transmitted from mother to child. “To check the spread of the disease through blood transfusion, we are going to introduce Nucleic Acid Test (,) to ensure immediate and accurate screening of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and , in donated blood,” Walia said. He added that Delhi is among the first few states to have introduced vaccination for hepatitis B in the universal immunization programme. Hepatitis A and E, the commonest forms of viral hepatitis, spread mainly through contaminated food or water. The state health minister said that they are taking all measures to ensure clean drinking water facility to all citizens. 
,
, The Delhi government is also planning to provide increased financial assistance to poor patients undergoing liver transplant, kidney transplant and other super-specialty procedures — Rs 3 lakh for those undergoing treatment at private hospitals and Rs 5 lakh for those being treated by government hospitals. 
,
, According to Dr Shiv Sarin, director, ILBS, hepatitis rarely presents symptoms until very late. “For example, a person infected with hepatitis C virus may carry the virus for as long as 10 years or even 20 years without presenting any obvious symptom. Regular health check-up is advised for people above 40 years of age,” he said.

, Tamil Nadu previously ranked in the top three with 1.54 lakh HIV-positive people, it has now been overtaken by Karnataka (2.45 lakh), and West Bengal (1.67 lakh). Andhra Pradesh, which accounts for 5 lakh of the 24 lakh HIV positive in the country, remains the state with the most number of HIV-infected people, official statistics show. 
,
, Government and private initiatives have helped reduce the number of people infected each year in the state, said officials of Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TNSACS). “Around 27,000 people tested positive for HIV in the state in 2009,” said a TNSACS official. “In 2010, the number dropped to 23,000, and in 2011, it fell further to 20,000. That’s a decrease of 7,000 new cases in two years.” 
,
, Activists attribute the success of the state’s AIDS programme to the commitment of the health sector and the government. “Tamil Nadu was the first state to start an autonomous AIDS control society and the model, backed by political will, has been very successful,” said Dr R Lakshmibai of Tamil Nadu Aids Initiative. “National AIDS Control Organisation has recommended the model to other states.” 
,
, The state has benefitted from specialized target intervention programmes that go beyond focusing on vulnerable groups such as sex workers, said M Ramar of Centre for Social Development and Social Work Research in Coimbatore who runs intervention programs for migrant workers. 
,
, “Once we started targeting their clients, which spans various groups like migrant workers, truckers and youngsters, things started looking better,” Ramar said. “I see a sense of awareness among migrant workers here. Fewer migrant workers than before are testing positive each year. Red ribbon clubs are also doing good work at college level.” 
,
, According to Dr Lakshmibai, intervention programmes prevented the disease from reaching generalised epidemic proportions. “There are three levels — nascent epidemic, concentrated epidemic and generalised epidemic,” she said. “The state never let it reach the generalised stage. When it looked like our intervention programs were only creating awareness and not changing behaviour, the state brought in specialised programmes.” 
,
, Andhra Pradesh, on the other hand, shut down 266 of its first-level detection and counselling centres due to a cash crunch. However, Dr Lakshmibai added that although Tamil Nadu is doing well, sustaining the effort to reduce the incidence of new cases will be a challenge. “Trends and sexual behaviour keeps changing,” she said. “Agencies have to keep track of all developments while designing preventive programmes.” 
,
, The state also has its work cut out in its intervention programme for transgenders. “The first survey was done only recently and shows that 9% of transgenders in the state are HIV-positive, a higher ratio than the 6% of female sex workers,” Dr Lakshmibai said.

, NEW DELHI: Almost 25 years after she identified India's first six cases of HIV way back in 1986, Dr , is on another pathbreaking hunt - to find a 'broadly neutralizing antibody' (bNab) from the blood of an Indian HIV patient. 
,
, There's a global hunt on for bNabs, a set of antibodies that can be found in the blood of HIV patients. These antibodies are capable of stopping the HIV virus from entering blood cells and replicating , thereby arresting an HIV-infected person's progression to AIDS. (An antibody is an infection-fighting protein produced by our immune system when it detects harmful substances like viruses and bacteria.) 
,
, Called Protocol G, the global project to identify bNabs was started in 2006 by the International Aids Vaccine Initiative (IAVI). So far, blood samples of 1,800 such HIV patients have been screened across 12 countries and 19 bNAbs identified. ,, IAVI president told TOI that these special antibodies hold vital clues to the design of an effective AIDS vaccine that has eluded scientists so far. 
,
, The Chennai-based Solomon is busy identifying a rare tribe of HIV-infected patients from across India who've been healthy for years without requiring life-saving anti-retroviral treatment (ART). These people are called ""elite controllers"" . ""The goal is to isolate antibodies that are broadly effective against Clade C subtype of HIV, which predominates in India,"" McGlynn added. 
,
, The blood samples collected are sent to the all-new Translational Health Sciences and Technology Institute (THSTI) in Gurgaon where scientists will isolate antibodies for testing and see if any of them can stop a variety of HIV subtypes from infecting their target cells. 
,
, Solomon, who works at YR Gaitonde Center for AIDS Research and Education (YRG CARE) said, ""Only a minority of people who are infected with HIV produce bNAbs. Although HIV is a wildly mutable virus, certain parts of it are relatively resistant to change. These are essential to the virus's ability to infect, and they are the elements of HIV that bNAbs target."" 
,
, Till now, blood samples from 39 elite controllers have been collected. ""We look for patients who've been infected for over four years but have not required ART. We estimate that of 100 such people, 20% would contain a bNab. We are collecting their blood samples and isolating cells that produce the bNab."" 
,
, Solomon's team aims to collect samples from 200 elite controllers. ""If IAVI manages to isolate a bNab from any of these blood samples, we will call the patient back and collect 200 ml of blood from him or her over a period of six months. We will then prepare more bNabs from it and try to develop a vaccine,"" she says. 
,
, IAVI India chief , says these antibodies could ultimately reveal the Achilles' heel of the virus and help create the HIV vaccine . Experts at the THSTI will look at how the bNab binds to the virus. This will tell scientists which part of the virus the vaccine should target. ""The idea is to create artificially synthesized mimics of their targets on HIV, to be used in vaccines to elicit similar actions and teach the immune system how to thwart HIV infection,"" experts said. 
,
, ""With 7,100 people contracting HIV every day, effective tools to prevent infection are indispensable in the fight against HIV. A broadlyeffective AIDS vaccine would be a powerful asset,"" said M K Bhan, secretary of the department of biotechnology. 
,
, No bNabs have yet been isolated in the India programme . But it's early days yet, said McGlynn. ""Serum samples collected will first be analyzed for their breadth of neutralization of HIV - in other words, the variety of HIV strains they can neutralize in laboratory assays. The most broadly neutralizing sera will be further analyzed to isolate and clone the antibodies responsible for that activity."" 
,
, Those antibodies will then be studied in detail for their biochemistry and, if possible, molecular structures and the structures that each targets on the HIV virus . The package of information gleaned will then be put to use to design a new class of the Aids vaccine.

It is admitted that the petitioner is an AIDS patient and the medical board found that he could discharge light duties.” , 	The driver joined the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation’s Salem division as a daily wager in May 1998 and in September 1999 his services were regularised.

In January 2010 he tested positive for HIV and began treatment at the Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital in Salem. , 	He was unable to discharge his regular duties due to his illness and was forced to take all the available leave. The management initiated punitive action against him for unauthorised absence from March 12, 2011.

, Madhu’s (name changed) life has just come crashing down. The 23-year-old, married for the past one-and-a-half years, has tested positive for HIV and she knows she has contracted it from her husband. Her family is distraught but there’s little they can do. “Now, we realise the importance of getting an HIV test done before marriage,” says her father. Madhu’s is not the only case. Many such instances across the country are highlighting an urgent need to make HIV test mandatory before marriage. The State , and Child Development department is actively considering the move. In fact, Varsha Gaikwad, Minister, Women and Child Development, recently said that her department had sought opinions in this regard from , and NGOs working for the welfare of HIV patients. But to bring about this rule, amendments to provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and other allied Acts, will be needed. And even though it looks like the need of the hour, it’s not that simple. In the past, such a move has encountered a number of hindrances. 
,
, 
,: 
,
, Some argue that making this test mandatory infringes upon a person’s right to privacy, which is a fundamental human right. Also, a big concern is that post-tests, an infected person may be ostracised in his/her community. 
,
, A generalised policy like this could adversely affect HIV control programme itself, as fear of social discrimination could force people to flee rather than come forward to declare their HIV status. 
,
, That apart, there are people opposing it because of the veracity of HIV tests. A wrong diagnosis could cause havoc in a person's life. Besides, there is something called a window period during which a person may test negative despite being infected. Says gynaecologist Dr Firuza Parekh, ""The HIV test is not fool-proof. At the time of testing, a person may come negative but turn positive six months later due to the window period. That apart, there's also the question of who will bear the cost of the test. So, what are we trying to prove through these tests? Is it just promiscuity because in that case, a person could even cheat by getting somebody else's test result."" 
,
, Sexologist and marriage counsellor Dr Shirish Malde, agrees. ""People might resort to getting fake test reports. Also, asking for this test can give rise to certain trust issues,"" he says. But the fact is that there are many cases where a person has contracted the virus from his/her partner and often it comes to fore when the woman is pregnant, he says. ""And the person who was already infected at the time of marriage tends to pretend or actually may not even have been aware. So making such a test mandatory before marriage may help,"" 
,
, 
,: 
,
, In Mumbai, a large section of people, especially youngsters, are of the opinion that the test must be made mandatory. ""People are worried to ask a potential groom in particular for a test, lest it upsets him and his family. But, it's as important as checking the kundlis in current times,"" says 26-year-old Tina Raina, a computer professional. A thought echoed by may others. Dr I S Gilada, President of AIDS Society of India, who has been working in this field for almost three decades, emphasises, ""This step may upset some people in our traditional society who might even call of a marriage. It's mainly young unsuspecting women who suffer in this. Human rights activists may say that declaring HIV status of one person to the other is violation of his/ her privacy. But doesn’t the potential spouse have a right to be protected from the disease? One’s right to privacy cannot infringe upon another’s right to life. In fact if it is made mandatory, there will be more awareness and more people going in for regular checkups."" 
,
, 
, 
,
, Instead of just an HIV test, a couple about to get married could undergo a comprehensive health check-up that includes tests for ,, thalassemia, haemophilia and other sexually transmitted diseases. ""This way we can ensure better medical compatibility between partners. And even if a partner tests positive for HIV, he/she can be rejected only as 'medically unfit' and won't have to carry the stigma of an , patient. Vice-verse, if they decide to go ahead with the marriage, it is with fullest knowledge and understanding, so they can’t blame anyone,"" says Gilada. States like Kerala, , and Goa in the past attempted to bring about such a rule, but could not succeed. Will Maharashtra manage to do it? Let's see... 
,
, 
,: 
,
, If such a bill is being considered, I’m glad it is because we definitely need this, especially in areas where education levels are low. Many suffer because of not having knowledge and rather than that suffering, it’s better you are aware of things beforehand. 
,
, 
, 
,
, There’s no clear-cut answer. In principle it seems logical enough: both partners should make an informed decision. But by legalising the process, not only do you bring the state into the bedroom, you also stigmatise HIV further. After all, there are many conditions that must be ascertained before we enter a partnership. Why aren’t those investigated? 
,
, 
, 
,
, Making the test mandatory could intensify the inhuman stigmatisation that HIV-positive individuals and AIDS patients grapple with. Brides and grooms must be encouraged to take the test before marriage, but it should be voluntary. 
,
, 
, 
,
, I totally agree with the government and feel everybody must go for a check-up every six months. Nowadays, people are indulging in all kinds of vices. Today, a wife doesn’t know if her husband has been in a relationship with another man or woman! 
,
, 
,: 
,
, In our country, where there is still a very prevalent arranged marriage system, a mandatory HIV test would be a boon. Due to our conservative society, these questions are barely asked. 
,
, 
,: 
,
, Alarming statistics show how children suffer because of their parents being HIV positive and women who not find out if their husbands are HIV positive suffer. It’s thus best to be aware. 
,
, 
, 
,
, Everyone should get an AIDS test; the government should organise this free of cost and have an awareness campaign on sex education. What is more of a concern, is how we treat those who are AIDS victims. 
,
, 
, 
,
, I totally support this move to have an HIV test before marriage; especially when one is beginning a family. It will also be a step towards removing the , attached with AIDS. 
,
, 
, 
,
, I agree with the move. Some families may not like it because they are traditional. I feel the issue is personal.

,
, Pradip, who is on Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART), faced great hardships in arranging money to buy nutritional diet few ahead of his ""Mr South Asia"" competition. Manipur Aids Control Society (MACS), which used to pay Rs 8000 a month to Pradipkumar for procuring his nutritional support after appointing him as its brand ambassador, has stopped paying the money to him since June.

I was a little scared in the beginning, but I made a lot of new friends,” she said coyly. 

, Maya is among the 34 residents of a children’s home in Bandikavanur village, about 30km from Chennai, who stepped into a school for the first time on Wednesday after HIV played havoc in their lives. They are all children of HIV+ve people. 
,
, While most of them have lost either or both of their parents, 19 of them inherited the virus. The children — 18 girls and 16 boys — were admitted to a primary school in the village in Thiruvallur district under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan’s ‘Education for all’ scheme. 
,
, For most of these children, the scheme gave them their first shot at leading a “normal” life. “I’ve often stood by the gate of the children’s home and watched school kids in uniforms jostle with one another. I wished I could join them and be their friend, but I wasn’t sure if they would accept me. Today, I finally got a chance to be a student,” said 10-year-old Mani*, who lost both his parents to HIV. 
,
, The 34 children, from across the state, are currently under the care of the Community Health Education Society (CHES), which has a home in the village that houses 85 HIV infected and affected children. Most of them find schooling difficult because of opposition from the school authorities and other parents who know about their health status. 
,
, Bandikavanur Panchayat Union Primary school principal N Shanthi said it wasn’t easy admitting these children. “In the beginning, we had decided not to reveal the children’s background, but word soon got around and we had parents approaching us asking if their wards would get infected. Explaining the situation wasn’t easy, but the panchayat head and elders in the village got together and explained things to them,” she said. The school also made provisions to cater to the medical needs of the children and the teachers are being trained to handle emergencies. 
,
, For CHES, it marks the end of a 19-year struggle. “For close to two decades, we have been trying to send HIV-affected children to mainstream schools, but few would admit them. Even if they were admitted, the children would drop out as they couldn't bear the discrimination. This is the first time a whole bunch of our children have been admitted to a school at one go,” said its president Dr P Manorama. 
,
, The NGO is also holding classes for these students to help them cope with their peers in the mainstream.

, The Global AIDS Epidemic 2012 report, released by , on Tuesday, says that the effects of such restrictions are severe for migrant workers, who play an increasingly prominent role in the global economy.
, 
, There is a blanket ban on entry of people living with HIV in five countries — Brunei Darussalam, Oman, Sudan, the UAE and Yemen.
, 
, Five other countries — Egypt, Singapore, Iraq, Qatar and Turks and Caicos Islands — require individuals wishing to stay for short periods (10–90 days) to prove that they are HIV-negative.
, 
, Laws in 20 countries, including Malaysia, Russia, Singapore, Jordan and Kuwait, deport individuals discovered to be living with HIV.
, 
, Even in the epidemic's fourth decade globally, nearly four in 10 countries worldwide still lack any specific legal provisions to prevent or address HIV-related discrimination.
, 
, The number of international migrants rose from 191 million to 214 million between 2005 and 2010.
, 
, The report says that the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) – Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE – all mandatorily test people seeking to come to the Gulf countries to work and require them to be periodically tested to renew visas.
, 
, ""Those who become HIV-positive while working in the Gulf are often quarantined, deported, denied appropriate health care and ostracized upon returning to their home countries. Migrants' HIV-positive test results are shared with all approved by the medical centres in the Gulf Cooperation Council, with such workers categorized as ""permanently unfit"" to enter any Gulf Cooperation Council country in the future,"" the report said.
, 
, India lifted all travel restrictions against HIV-positive patients in 2010.
, 
, In 2002, the Union health ministry had issued a notification, stating that mandatory test for HIV for India-bound foreign nationals should be removed from visa forms. However, some embassies failed to enforce it, and continued to display the requirement of HIV test certificate on their websites as well as on visa forms.
, 
, On September 17, 2010, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) clarified that there are no travel or residency restrictions for People Living with HIV (PLHIV) coming to India.
, 
, UNAIDS says that most of these restrictions were imposed in the early years of the epidemic, when little was understood about HIV prevention and effective HIV treatment did not exist.
, 
, ""In 2012, governments increasingly recognize that these restrictions make no sense in a world in which HIV exists in every country, people living with HIV are living long and productive lives and equal freedom of movement is not only a human right but essential in a globalized world. Of note is the decline in the number of countries, territories and areas with HIV-related travel restrictions from 96 in 2000 to 45 in 2012,"" UNAIDS said.
, 
, UNAIDS aims to eliminate these restrictions by 2015.
, 
, Since 2010, Armenia, China, Fiji, Namibia, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of Moldova, Ukraine and the US have repealed such restrictions. Where such restrictions continue to exist, other forms of HIV stigma and discrimination are usually common.
, 
, The World Health Organization (WHO) pointed out that such entry restrictions mount pressure on people into concealing their HIV infection from immigration authorities.
, 
, ""They simply do not carry their HIV medicines on international trips. This could lead to drug-resistant HIV strains that are transmissible to other people. Besides, drug resistance allows HIV to replicate in the body more freely, people with higher viral loads are also more infectious,"" WHO said.

"Updated: Nov 20, 2012, 06:34 IST",'HIV prevalence high among floating masses',"JAIPUR: Diwali is the time for several people, who migrate to other cities for work, to return home and take part in family celebrations. However, for the , (RSACS), this was the best time to organize 10-day health camps, with HIV testing facilities, in districts which see a large population migrating to bigger cities for work. 

, The results of the tests were an eye opener as high prevalence of HIV infection was found among the migrating population. The health department officials were shocked to find that the wives of these workers, many of them pregnant, also tested HIV positive. 
,
, At least 65 cases of HIV were detected at the health camps set up in nine districts between November 1 and November 10. These districts were Ajmer, Bhilwara, Bikaner, Sriganganagar, Jodhpur, ,, Pali, Sikar and Udaipur. 
,
, Those who tested positive for HIV were unaware that they were being infected with the virus, which once again stresses on the need for strengthening HIV surveillance in the districts. , (AIDS) Dr JP Dhamija said, ""It was the best time for launching the HIV testing in nine districts as large number of out-migratory people return to their homes to celebrate Diwali. We did not force them for HIV testing but they voluntarily came at the health camps organized in the respective areas. The camps were successful as we tested 15,975 persons for HIV."" 
,
, Several pregnant women were found to be infected with HIV virus. In Sikar district, a pregnant woman was immediately referred to a hospital to prevent transmission of virus to the fetus. Two more pregnant women tested positive for HIV in Nagaur.

"Updated: Nov 28, 2012, 14:27 IST",HIV figures not alarming: officials,"RAIPUR: Officials admitted that they have recently started a follow up exercise of convincing the dropouts to return.
 
, Officials said that an increasing awareness on the disease could be one of the reasons for rise in patients. ""We have also increased the number of , (ICTC) and patients coming to these also reflect on the statistics,"" said Dr SK Binjhwar, Additional Project director, , State , Control Society (CSACS). Officials said the figure was low and not alarming, as it equates to a prevalence of 0.3%. At the same time, they feel that AIDS vulnerability is high in Chhattisgarh as it shares its geographical borders with Maharashtra, ,, , and Orissa, which are all high AIDS prevalence states.
, 
, The figure is constantly rising, especially in the high-risk age group of 15-35 years, which is basically described as the productivity period, according to health officials.
, 
, There are various other factors, all of which add up to bring the second-largest city, ,, to second place with 1,992 , positive people. Educational hub Durg-Bhilai has 1,865 patients.
, 
, In Bastar, 125 people were tested positive last year, which have increased to 79 in the first half of 2012. Likewise, in Dantewada, the figure for the first half of the year has crossed last year's figure, as nine people were tested HIV positive in 2011 while 11 have already been identified this year.

"Updated: Nov 21, 2012, 02:57 IST",India records 25% dip in new HIV infections,"NEW DELHI: First the good news: globally there were more than half a million fewer AIDS-related deaths in 2011 than in 2005, with India reporting a 25% dip in the rate of new , between 2001 and 2011.
 
, But even then last year alone, 1.7 million people died from AIDS-related causes worldwide. Globally, 2.5 million people became newly infected with HIV in 2011.
, 
, Half of all reductions in new HIV infections in the last two years have been among newborn children showing that elimination of new infections in children is possible.
, 
, In 2011, there were 34 million people living with HIV. In South and south-east Asia, an estimated 4 million people were living with HIV in 2011, compared to 3.7 million in 2001.
, 
, The same year, new infections in children were 43% lower than in 2003, and 24% lower than 2009. However, 72% of children living with HIV do not have any access to treatment.
, 
, An estimated 6.8 million people are eligible for treatment, but don't have access.
, 
, These are the findings of the Global , Epidemic 2012 report released by UNAIDS on Tuesday. The number of people accessing HIV treatment has increased by 63% between 2009 and 2011.
, 
, In India, however, around 60% people requiring treatment are getting it. ""The pace of progress is quickening — what used to take a decade is now being achieved in 24 months,"" said Michel Sidibé, executive director of UNAIDS. ""We are scaling up faster and smarter than ever before. It is the proof that with political will and follow through we can reach our shared goals by 2015,"" he said.
, 
, Gains have been made in reducing tuberculosis (TB)-related AIDS deaths in people living with HIV. In the last 24 months, a 13% decrease in TB-related AIDS deaths was observed. This accomplishment is due to record number of people with HIV/TB co-infection accessing antiretroviral treatment, which is recorded at 45%.
, 
, UNAIDS also estimates that an additional 4 million discordant couples (where one partner is living with HIV) would benefit from HIV treatment to protect their partners from HIV infection.
, 
, Of the 34 million people living with HIV, about half do not know their HIV status. The report states that if more people knew their status, they could come forward for HIV services.
, 
, For example, South Africa increased its scale up of HIV treatment by 75% in the last two years—ensuring 1.7 million people had access to the lifesaving treatment—and new HIV infections have fallen by more than 50,000 in only two years.
, 
, The report shows that a more than 50% reduction in the rate of new HIV infections has been achieved across 25 low and middle-income countries –– more than half in Africa, the region most affected by HIV.
, 
, In some of the countries which have the highest HIV prevalence in the world, rates of new HIV infections have been cut dramatically since 2001 — by 73% in Malawi, Botswana (71%), Namibia (68%), Zambia (58%), Zimbabwe (50%), South Africa and Swaziland (41%).
, 
, In addition to welcome results in HIV prevention, sub-Saharan Africa has reduced AIDS-related deaths by one-third in the last six years and increased the number of people on antiretroviral treatment by 59% in the last two years alone.
, 
, The area where perhaps most progress is being made is in reducing new HIV infections in children. Half of the global reductions in new HIV infections in the last two years have been among newborn children. ""It is becoming evident that achieving zero new HIV infections in children is possible,"" said Sidibé. ""I am excited that far fewer babies are being born with HIV. We are moving from despair to hope,"" he added.
, 
, The report shows that antiretroviral therapy has emerged as a powerful force for saving lives. In the last 24 months the numbers of people accessing treatment has increased by 63% globally. In sub-Saharan Africa, a record 2.3 million people had access to treatment. China has increased the number of people on HIV treatment by nearly 50% in the last year alone. There were more than half a million fewer deaths in 2011 than in 2005. The largest drops in AIDS-related deaths are being seen in countries where HIV has the strongest grip. South Africa saw (100,000) fewer deaths, Zimbabwe (nearly 90,000), Kenya (71,000) and Ethiopia (48,000) than in 2005.

, The organisations titled ‘Network of People and Children Living with HIV (NPCLH)’ have a seven member team; two men and five women. “Like any other organisation we are not limited to identify HIV patients and fighting for their health care issues with the government, but we also intend to strengthen the confidence among the patients to such an extent that they can lead a self-respecting life,” said Yogita, the president of the organisation. 
,
, The organisation, which started two years back, was only a given legal frame-work in October this year. “NGO – Yash Foundation – that receives grant from Mahindra and Mahindra have helped and guided for four years. We realized that the lives of PCLHs can be made beautiful with medication and support and we can lead a normal life and perform all activities that others do. Now it is time for us to take it forward,” Yogita added. 
,
, The HIV ‘positive’ people have already been visiting the antiretroviral therapy centres, interacting with other patients, fighting for fair treatment to the people admitted in civil hospital, tracing patients, counseling them and their relatives, providing meals for patients as well as their relatives during their stay in hospitals and providing legal aid. They are also rehabilitating people based on their qualifications and ability to work. 
,
, “Today we have more than 300 positive people. Women unwilling or unable to go out and work are given the works to stitch gloves, while some others are engaged in managing files in rehabilitation centre. But there is a large numbers of positive patients who have been employed in engineering, pharmaceuticals or even other companies as well,” said Radhika, an office-bearer of the NPC. 
,
, Yogita said that the organisation was planning to open a hostel for women and children primarily and even for men. There are several donors for the project, but, there is no land available yet. 
,
, Ravindra Patil of the foundations said, “The concept of the support group is overwhelming and the foundation is ready to provide all the guidance necessary. However, now it has to ensure that it can sustain itself. The members are definitely capable of doing it.”

, 
, The district has one more reason to cheer. The percentage of HIV positive cases in the district is much lesser than that in Karnataka.

, ""The Prevention of , (PCTP), which was launched in 2006, yielded considerable result. Earlier, an average of 30-40 per cent of the children born to HIV positive women used to be HIV positive. However, this has reduced to 3 - 4 per cent after PCTP was introduced. Under PCTP, Nevirapine, anti-retroviral (ART) tablets, are given to pregnant women living with HIV. Nevirapine syrup is given to new born babies,"" Dr Kishore said.
, 
, The Union government has introduced another PCTP to check the transmission of HIV recently, wherein anti-retroviral medicines are administered to HIV positive women from their fourth month of pregnancy, Kishore said adding that the programme is aimed at bringing the parent to children transmission rate to zero in the district. The number of HIV positive pregnant women too has reduced considerably in the district in the past five years. While 79 out of 14,764 pregnant women tested positive in 2007, the number has decreased to 20 out of 19,515 in 2012.

, There has been a 57% reduction in new HIV infections in India during the last decade with HIV prevalence among adults (15-49 years) dipping to 0.27% (2011) compared to 0.33% (2007). 
,
, The total number of people living with , (PLHIV) in India is estimated at 21 lakhs last year. Children (below 15 years) account for 7% of all infections, and 86% are in the 15-49 age bracket. 
,
, Worryingly, of all the HIV infections, 39% (8.16 lakhs) are among ,, most of whom being housewives. 
,
, The new HIV estimated released by Union health minister , on Friday – on the eve of the , — says that around 1.16 lakh new HIV infections among adults and around 14,500 new infections among children had occurred last year. 
,
, Of the 1.16 lakh estimated new infections in 2011 among adults, the six high-prevalence states of ,, ,, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Manipur and , accounted for 31% of new infections. 
,
, Considerable declines in HIV prevalence have been recorded among female sex workers at national level (5.06% in 2007 to 2.67% in 2011) and in most of the states, where long-standing targeted interventions have focused on behaviour change and increase in condom use. Declines have been achieved among men who have sex with men (7.41% in 2007 to 4.43% in 2011) also, though several pockets in the country show higher HIV prevalence among them with mixed results. 
,
, Reduction in HIV cases among Injecting Drug Users (IDUs) at , level haven’t been significant (7.23% in 2007 to 7.14% in 2011). 
,
, Besides north-eastern states where declines have been achieved, newer pockets of high HIV prevalence among IDUs have emerged over the last few years, mainly in states like Punjab, Chandigarh, Delhi, Mumbai, Kerala, Odisha, ,, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. 
,
, The report says that scale up of free anti retroviral treatment (ART) since 2004 has saved over 1.5 lakh lives till last year. 
,
, At the current pace of scale up of ART services, it is estimated to avert around 50,000–60,000 deaths annually in the next five years. 
,
, Azad told TOI, “India’s progress in controlling the deadly virus has been remarkable. China, India and South , are the only three countries which have witnessed a fall in new HIV cases by over 50%. The recent UN general assembly on HIV unanimously hailed these countries for such progress.” 
,
, In 2011, among the states, Manipur has shown the highest estimated adult HIV prevalence of 1.22%, followed by Andhra Pradesh (0.75%), Mizoram (0.74%), Nagaland (0.73%), Karnataka (0.52%), Goa (0.43%) and Maharashtra (0.42%). 
,
, Besides these, Odisha, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, and Chandigarh have shown estimated adult HIV prevalence greater than the national prevalence at 0.27%. 
,
, The study said, “The adult HIV prevalence at national level has continued its steady decline from estimated level of 0.41% in 2001 through 0.35% in 2006 to 0.27% in 2011. Similar consistent declines are noted among both males and females at national level.” 
,
, About 1.48 lakh people died of AIDS-related causes in India last year. Deaths among HIV infected children account for 7% of all AIDS-related deaths. Wider access to ART has led to 29% reduction in estimated annual AIDS-related deaths during NACP-III period (2007-2011). 
,
, Thanks to fall in India’s HIV numbers, south-east Asia (11 countries, including India) has seen a 35% dip in new HIV infections, from 3.2 lakhs (2001) to 2.08 lakhs (2011). According to the , (WHO), the HIV epidemic is clearly reversing. In 2011, 2.2 million people across the world were infected with HIV and 1.7 million died, half a million fewer new infections than 10 years ago, and 6 lakhs fewer deaths than 2005. However, the global health watch dog said the region also faces serious challenges. In the region, 46% of adults in need of treatment were enrolled in care and treatment by the end of 2011 – up from 12% in 2005. The coverage for HIV treatment in children is 39% in 2011 – up from 9% in 2005. Starting treatment early reduces morbidity and mortality due to HIV, and recent studies have also confirmed the prevention benefits of early treatment in uninfected regular sexual partners of HIV-infected individuals. 
,
, “The overall decline in the region is cause for increased optimism, however complacency now could become our greatest enemy,” said Dr Samlee Plianbangchang, regional director of WHO south-east Asia. 
,
, “Those most vulnerable to HIV are also among the least empowered and HIV prevention care and treatment services for these people need to be made available and accessible,” he added.

, Director, centre of excellence, National , Control Organisation (,), Banaras Hindu University, Shyam Sundar said HIV infection is a common trend in north eastern states specially Manipur, but the trend is now seen in Varanasi as well. 
,
, “At present around 10 HIV patients are being treated in the ART centre, BHU. They are not backpackers or foreigners but natives of the city, who are youngsters and middle-aged people. Such drug abusers are often seen at ghats and older parts of the city. Mass sharing of the syringe and needle is often a common practice by drug abusers that invites HIV infection. The trend is catching fast which is very unlikely for a city like Varanasi,” Sunder added. 
,
, The officials of NACO, Varanasi, stated that the entire eastern UP area is turning out to be a highly sensitive zone for HIV infections because of migration from rural to urban slum areas and even metropolitan cities. Jaunpur, Azamgarh and Ghazipur are identified as the highly sensitive districts. Varanasi ranks at number four. Most of these patients are in the age group of 20 to 45 years and bread winners for the families. Almost 90 per cent of the patients belong to lower middle class families and have poor economic conditions. 
,
, Recently, new ART centres (for first line treatment) have been opened in Ghazipur, Azamgarh, Jaunpur and the district hospital in Varanasi but the region’s vulnerability towards the HIV infection is not decreasing the number of patients at ART centre, BHU. Around 300 to 350 patients are arriving at the centre every day. NACO nodal centre in BHU is also the ART centre which was formed in 2005. Already emerged as centre of excellence along with only three other ART centres in northern India, it is providing qualitative first line and second line treatment for AIDS. 
,
, Apart from screening and treatment of HIV patients, the centre boasts of other facilities like integrated counselling and testing centre (ICTC), Suraksha Clinic (STD clinic) and counselling centre for prevention of parent to child transmission (PPCTC). 
,
, “At present, as many as 15,819 HIV positive patients are registered in the centre. Earlier low turnout of HIV positive people coming for screening and treatment at the centre was troubling the experts, but now we are overcoming this problem by identifying people and arranging meeting with ICTC and other centres. Around 80 per cent of patients are now turning up for treatment,” Sunder added.

, 
, The HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) 2010-11, which was released by Union health minister , on Friday, revealed that new infections among FSW have reduced in comparison to the figures of HSS 2008-09.
, 
, The HSS showed that the HIV prevalence among FSW in 2010-11 has reduced from 3.82% to 1.28%. The national average of HIV prevalence among sex workers is 2.67%. In Rajasthan, the HIV prevalence among sex workers is below the national average.
, 
, As part of the HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention programme, the , (NACO) and the , (RSACS) have been promoting sale of condoms among high-risk groups which include sex workers in the state under the Condom Social Marketing (CSM) programme. They have also opened more than 9,228 non-traditional outlets, to sell condoms in the state to minimize the risk of HIV infection and also to reduce total fertility rate.
, 
, The NGOs working for health of sex workers claimed that the FSW have become more attentive to their health. Yuwa Bharat Sansthan programme manager , said, ""We have been working for FSW for a long time. Among the 600 FSWs in Jaipur with whom we are working, only one was tested positive for HIV.""
, 
, She said the FSWs are using precautions properly to prevent HIV infection. ""Some of FSWs go to other states, which have high HIV prevalence, which is quite risky for them, but they are more careful there about their health,"" Shekhawat said.
, 
, The FSWs undergo routine health check-up. The RSACS has also introduced targeted intervention to keep a check on the spread of prevalence of HIV among FSWs. There are around 22 targeted interventions working with FSW population in the state, RSACS sources said.
, 
, In a survey conducted in 2005-06, it was found that there were 21,301 female sex workers in the state but now the number of FSW must have increased, an RSACS source added.

"Updated: Dec 2, 2012, 05:17 IST",HIV positive children cry for attention,"MADURAI: Five-year-old , (name changed), a UKG student, is today a bubbly girl who is the cynosure of all eyes at the ,, where she lives along with 10 other HIV positive parentless boys and girls. But her early childhood was one of hardship and there are many out in the community in want of attention. 

, According to ,, founder-director of Russ Foundation, each of these children have a story of their own, but have successfully come out of their trauma and are doing well in the mainstream education system. Chittu for example was born to a female sex worker who made her income on the streets of Madurai. The woman who had a partner who was already married and had two children, was being used by him to make money. When she became sick and realized she was going to die of AIDS, she brought her three-year-old child, who was already begging on the streets of Madurai, to the home for adoption. She died a few days later. Her partner, however, who could not prove that he was the biological father of this child, was reluctant to give up the child because he had already chalked out plans to make money by making her beg. ""We went through a tough battle with him before the authorities handed her over to us,"" said Jose. 
,
, Initially, the girl's stomach which was used to scavenging on food on the roadside, could not tolerate the well cooked warm food offered at the home. This HIV positive child suffered frequent bouts of diarrhoea. Staff at the home sometimes found her searching garbage bins for food and feeding on leftovers. ""It took us two whole months to bring her around and now she is doing very well in a normal school,"" he said. 
,
, Apart from the children of the home, the foundation also works with 77 HIV positive children living in the community and about 650 non-infected children of HIV positive parents. 
,
, This foundation has been able to successfully integrate HIV positive girls and boys into mainstream society, by their regular counseling and life skills classes. But according to Jose, girls more than boys face a lot of trauma on attaining puberty because society tries to stigmatize them as immoral persons. ""This is when they start hating their parents who are no longer alive. These girls become suicidal and depressed and need a lot of handholding to start realizing their potential as good individuals in society,"" he said. 
,
, Boys on the other hand start thinking of life ahead and a future. Kumar, a boy who was expelled from a home for his mischief, is today a sturdy 18-year-old pursuing his SSLC at this home. He is also a caring brother to the smaller children; he wants to take up a career as a mechanical engineer. Selvam on the other hand who was brought to the home by his grandmother and aunt because his other relatives did not want him among them has no wish to study. But he is good with gadgets and wants to look after his grandmother and aunt well. 
,
, On ,, these children had a feast with 800 others to celebrate the occasion and look forward to life ahead. 
,
, Jose says it is encouraging that the incidence of HIV/AIDS has come down in the state but added that the government should formulate a policy for the care and support for persons living with HIV/AIDS. ""In no way should AIDS control programmes be relaxed because there are many who still have not been brought back into mainstream society,"" he adds.

, 
, The HIV prevalence in the age group of 15-49 years in the state has increased from 0.19% in 2008-09 to 0.49% in 2010-11, the report stated. While the national figures registered a dip of 0.27% for the same time frame, in Rajasthan the number of cases shot up by 0.30%.
, 
, At the antenatal clinics, the HIV prevalence in Rajasthan is higher than neighbouring state Gujarat, which traditionally has a high number of pregnant women testing positive for HIV every year. According to the report, one out of 200 pregnant women tested positive for HIV in 2010-11 against one in 500 in 2008-09.
, 
, The figures present a scary picture as the HIV prevalence among pregnant women has increased by more than two times.
, 
, A large number of people also migrate to other big cities that have a high HIV prevalence which puts the state in the highly vulnerable category. People go to work in states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, , which have high HIV prevalence, a health department official said.
, 
, ""A large number of truckers pass through the state who are potential carriers of the HIV virus,"" another official said citing it as one of the reasons for high number of HIV positive cases in the state.

However, her world literally fell apart when after few months of marriage, her husband tested positive for HIV. 

, Her fears of having been infected by her husband proved incorrect when she tested negative. Many thoughts, including deserting Abhinav, crossed her mind then but she was truly in love with him. In her own words the ""thought of letting a virus ruin her married life was just not correct"". Though she decided to stay with Abhinav, her dreams of having children were shattered as unprotected sex with her husband could not only put her at risk of contracting the disease but could also infect the child that she desperately wanted. The couple had given up all hopes till someone told them that it might be possible for them to have their child through the assisted in-vitro fertilization (IVF) reproduction technique. 
,
, After consultations with city-based doctors the couple went ahead with IVF and is now expecting their first child in another two months. ""We are praying that the child is free from HIV"", they say. 
,
, While they may have some doubts, the doctors who carried out the procedure on them are however confident that the child would be ""normal and healthy"". However, they refused to disclose the name of nursing home as such patients object on it. 
,
, Dr ,, a leading city-based practitioner, said that world over, more than 400 cases have been documented where couples, with HIV positive husbands, have successfully had children through IVF/IUI technique. ""We have also used the same technique on several couples and are sure that their child too would be healthy"", she says. 
,
, Elaborating, Dr Pahalajani said, however in IVF- ICSI (intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection) technique, the husband's semen, which carries the infection, is washed thoroughly using specific medical solutions and one single sperm is picked to fertilize the egg. The embryo is subsequently transferred into the mother's womb. But it is not 100% risk free. So they can also adopt other procedure of donor's sperm. 
,
, Dr Pahalajani says with acceptance about HIV growing in the society, it is the responsibility of the medical fraternity to offer solutions to the HIV-infected couples to raise healthy families.

Dr Sunil Arora, in charge NACO state reference laboratory, PGI, said, “There are few public labs which are under NABL. Annually, a report will be prepared for the renewal of the certificate. This report is considered verified and error-free by any HIV lab worldwide.” 
,
, There are 800 HIV+ patients in the city who are registered with the PGI. The lab is also working on understanding why some HIV patients do not respond to some particular sets of medicines and have to be switched over to another regime, which has more side effects. “Anti-retroviral treatment has been found to be ineffective in some of the positives. Our lab is working on developing a model to resolve the problem,” said Dr Arora. 
,

, But for Union health minister ,, it’s an unreachable target in the near future. He has strongly contradicted the global theme. The minister told TOI “in no way can India achieve such a target in the near future. In fact no country can do so.” “Zero discrimination”, according to him, is a far cry. 
,
, On Friday, Azad told Parliament that discrimination is rampant in India. 
,
, The minister said the operational guidelines for ART services clearly mention that “irrespective of HIV status of a person, all patients are entitled to receive general and special out patient and inpatient services in a hospital.” 
,
, He added that “confidentiality should be maintained at all levels irrespective of HIV status as per medical ethics and the law.” But he admitted that cases of discrimination “are reported from time to time”. 
,
, According to him, in the last three years, 21 cases of discrimination have been reported – nine from Karnataka, Delhi (4), , (3), , (2) and Maharashtra, , and Odisha (1 each). 
,
, Around 11 cases of suicides by , patients have also been reported during the same time – 6 from Karnataka, Gujarat (3) and Delhi and Tamil Nadu (1 each) to the state grievance redressal committees. 
,

,
, “North India has been slow to address the HIV threat. Southern states have done better,” said Azad. 
,
, New HIV infections in children are down, but reaching the goal of an AIDS-free generation requires that more HIV+ pregnant , receive antiretroviral treatment to decrease the risk of infection for their babies, said , on Saturday.

,
, The total number of people living with HIV in the country has seen a decline from approximately 2.3 million to 2.1 million. The drop has been much higher among men (16%) than women (2.6%). 
,
, “Thanks to remarkable global commitment, the world has seen a 24% reduction in new HIV infections in children – from 430,000 in 2009 to 330,000 in 2011. Much progress has been made in the field of treatment. In low and middle-income countries, coverage of effective antiretroviral treatment for preventing mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) reached 57% in 2011,” Unicef added. 
,
, Regarding access to treatment of children in need, it increased from 6% in 2006, when the pediatric HIV programme was launched in India to 34% last year. 
,
, “It is simply wrong that adults are twice as likely as children to receive the treatment they need,” said ,, executive director of Unicef. “By definition, an AIDS-free generation depends on protecting the youngest and most vulnerable from HIV infection. We must do still more to help mothers and children who live with HIV be able to live free from AIDS. 
,

, 
, ""Though government boasts of many steps taken by it for curbing the virus spread, initiatives are not reaching till the grassroot level.

, SACS data reveals that the prevalence of HIV in Chandigarh has dropped from .25% to .23% of the total city’s population this year. Experts attribute the decline to increasing awareness and effective reaching out to high risk groups. However, the city remains in Category B, the same as Mumbai. This year’s theme of World AIDS Day is “Getting to zero: Zero new HIV infections. Zero discrimination. Zero AIDS related deaths”. According to the latest figures of UNAIDS, 2.4 million people in the country are living with HIV. The prevalence rate nationally is 0.3% of the population. 
,
, SACS director Dr Vanita Gupta said, “Out of the 21,120 pregnant women tested since 2008, 42 have tested positive. The number has reduced as there were 60 positives in 2008. However, the city comes under category B of HIV/AIDS due to injectable drug users, which is high in adjoining states of Punjab and Haryana.” Meanwhile, the new case detection rate among walk-in voluntary testing of public in the ICTC centres of Chandigarh has declined from 7.1% in 2008 to 2.19% in 2012. This year the SACS has been sanctioned to start two more oral substitution therapy centres in the city to gradually wean off injectable drug users to oral therapy. “We already have eight such centres,” revealed the director. 
,
, The SACS has plans to rope in college and university students for spreading the message of prevention against HIV. “We have been working with the ITBP and will be sensitizing defence personnel also,” said Dr Gupta.

As things turned out, she got married and got infected. The husband is no more but there’s her, two children and the virus. 

, In a country where people living with AIDS are still subjected to ostracism, a lone HIV positive woman with two children did not really stand a chance. But there is something to be said about sheer grit. If you have it, even gunny bags can give you a lease of life. In Sangeeta’s case, the gunny bags came with something even more precious – dignity. The feisty lady has received a bulk contract from a Kalka-based company to sew gunny bags for Rs 4,000 month. On World Aids Day, nine women living with AIDS joined her to make a living sewing gunny bags. She calls women living with AIDS on her mobile phone. One, she proudly points out, she bought herself. 
,
, At 31, Saumya is treading the same path. Like Sangeeta, Saumya lost her husband, who was HIV positive. Unlike Sangeeta, the legacy she received included not only HIV but also TB. It was not possible for her to work anywhere till people from the drop-in-centre approached her to help her earn by stitching gunny bags. She is also trying to reach out to women deprived of care when they need it the most. “I have seen the vicissitudes of life and I am trying to guide women suffering the same way,” she said. 
,
, It was Archana, in-charge of the drop-in-centre who conceived the idea of helping women with the craft of making polybags. Archana, who lives with AIDS herself, plans to expand operations to include more women in the ambit of the self-sustaining group. 
,
, “We went to Anandpur Sahib a few days ago where we saw women working on recycled paper for a well known company. Though the marketing was not impressive, it generated Rs 1,500 per month. We decided to modify the concept and raise income for the women,” she said. 
,
, While the centre has a special machine to imprint the names that buyers want, they also plan to buy a machine which can be used to make disposable cups and glasses. “With these self employment schemes, we will expand services to all 100 women living with HIV in the city,” said Archana.

, Earlier, the HIV testing facilities were available at all government medical colleges, district hospitals and community heath centres of seven high risk districts. Now, RSACS has decided not to keep confine the HIV testing facilities at high risk districts but also to expand it to other districts as well.
, 
, ""Rajasthan has a special situation in terms of equal HIV prevalence rates of both urban and rural areas,"" an RSACS official said.
, 
, The official said already 182 Integrated Counseling and Testing Centres (ICTC) are in the state. However, majority of the ICTCs were located at seven districts - Jaipur, Ajmer, Alwar, Tonk, Udaipur, Barmar and Sriganganagar. Except in these seven districts, the other districts lack testing centres. The HIV testing in private hospitals is costly but at the government's centres, it is free of cost, the official said, adding that expanding the testing facility would strengthen healthcare facilities in the state.
, 
, Apart from 182, another 282 more testing centres would be opened in the state with help from the staff of the community health centres (CHC). The RSACS would provide HIV testing kits to the CHCs. Trained counselors would be posted at the CHCs and would counsel people coming to the centre for HIV testing. For the purpose, the RSACS would provide training to , (NRHM) employees deployed at the CHCs.

The prevalence of HIV among pregnant women in the seven coastal districts combined is 0.81 per cent, which is more than the state average of 0.77 per cent. 

, As per , (APSACS) data, the highest prevalence of HIV among pregnant women is in Kadapa (2.25 %), followed by the coastal district of East Godavari (1.25 per cent). In Krishna (1 %), Guntur (1.08 %) and West Godavari it is close to the state average. Vizag, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam are however a little lower than the state average. 
,
, Project director of APSACS C Partha Sarathi said, ""We have given special focus on prevention of new infections from pregnant women to newborns during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. The vertical (mother to child) transmission rate without any medication is around 30 per cent. During the last National Aids Control Programme (NACP), we were able to bring down this transmission rate to about 10 per cent with single dose Nevirapine prophylaxis in the mother-baby pairs. But AP is now piloting the superior triple drug regime, which aims at bringing down the HIV infection in newborns to around three per cent."" 
,
, Recently, , and Karnataka launched the PPTCT (prevention of parent to child transmission) 'triple drug regimen'. ""There will be a paradigm shift with the triple-drug regimen. The state is now looking forward to bringing down the mother-to-child transmission to zero,"" said state epidemiologist K Jaya Krishna and deputy director (monitoring, evaluation and surveillance), APSACS. 
,
, Ronanki Ramesh, additional district medical and health officer (AIDS and leprosy), Visakhapatnam, said, ""Around 85 per cent of HIV transmission happens due to unsafe sex, while around 15 per cent is passed on from the pregnant mother to the child. It's now possible to stop vertical transmission by 98 per cent with the use of a combination of three ARV drugs starting from 14 weeks of pregnancy irrespective of CD4 count till the end of breastfeeding that is up to one or one and a half years. Soon after delivery, the infant will be given Nevarapine syrup for six weeks to be followed up for DBS-PCR tests till 18 months. The triple drug regimen under Mamta Plus programme also spikes the risk of drug resistance,"" he stated. 
,
, AP is planning to give special importance to counselling and testing programme in the coming year and has set a target for 35 lakh tests (including 15 lakhs pregnant women). 
,
, Overall, according to APSACS, new infections are on the decline in the state with an approximately 23 per cent decline in new infections being recorded in 2009 in comparison to 2006. ANC prevalence dropped down to less than 1% (0.77%) for the first time in 2010, as per the latest survey.

The mom-to-be, who hails from the Old Town area, discovered to her horror that she had tested positive for ,.
 
, What unfolded thereafter was nothing short of a tragedy. The child she gave birth to was born HIV positive and died within weeks of birth. Her husband Raju (name changed), whom she married in 2008 and was one who allegedly passed on the infection to her, died a few months ago because of infections generally associated with the disease.
, 
, Now Sujatha's family members have lodged a police complaint with the One Town police station against Raju's family, alleging that he deliberately hid his HIV status at the time of marriage and infected an innocent woman. They are demanding that Raju's family bear the cost of Sujata's treatment, as she hails from a not so well-to-do family.
, 
, ""She is on ARV (anti-retroviral drugs) and her monthly medicine bill alone comes to about Rs 3000. The drugs along with other medicines and nutritional food are very costly. She was infected by her husband and now it is their turn to take care of her,"" her mother Savitri said.
, 
, Similar cases of persons getting married without disclosing his or her health status are on the rise. Recently, another such case came to light in a very well-known and affluent family. Luckily the bride's parents came to know about the groom's HIV positive status on the wedding morning and demanded he undergo a medical test due to which he was caught, says Dr Kutikuppla Surya Rao, a doctor who has been treating HIV/AIDS affected since the last two decades.
, 
, But most cases do not come to light due to the stigma attached to the disease. In fact, police officials at One Town station admitted that Sujata's was the first such case to be lodged with them. ""We are aware of such things and will not hesitate to book a case but most people do not come forward as stigma of being HIV/AIDS positive still prevails. Things can change only when people come out of their shell and lodge a complaint,"" said an official of One Town police station.
, 
, For several years, this has been the subject of a raging debate - should both the bride and the groom be made to undergo HIV/AIDS test before marriage?
, 
, ""This issue was first raised at a NACO summit chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2001. The discussion then moved to Parliament but never translated into an Act or rule. It has been watered down to the level that if an innocent woman or man is infected by his or her partner, then he or she can lodge a complaint in the police station or file a case for compensation or treatment charges. But that is not sufficient in the present condition,"" pointed out Dr Surya Rao.
, 
, The medical practitioner says that such cases have been on the rise and he has seen about 30 to 40 such cases in the last two years. ""In a majority of the cases, it has been men infecting women, with just a few stray cases the other way around. And 80 per cent of them were aware of their HIV status. Being aware and then getting married is a crime. Though 2012 is considered to be a path breaking year for HIV/AIDS research as the treatment is moving from prevention phase to cure status, it is still a crime to infect another purposefully. There is, however, no problem if two positive persons get married,"" he said.
, 
, Though as per a NACO report the prevalence of HIV/AIDS is on the decline, Dr G Prabhakar of Green Vision pointed out that the decline was being witnessed in high risk group such as commercial sex workers (CSWs), truckers and migrant workers. ""The worrying factor is that the growing promiscuity among youth has led to an upswing in the incidence of the disease in the middle and affluent classes. Though there is no survey to establish this fact, as a medical practitioner actively involved in this segment, I think there has been a growth of at least 10 per cent over the last decade,"" said Dr Prabhakar.

, Statistics of the , (GSACS) show 14 persons contracted the virus up to October this year as against four persons in the corresponding period last year; a rise of over 300%. The state's , body for control of , in Goa, incidentally, doesn't receive data of blood tests done at private laboratories, so the numbers-including the overall for the state-could be higher, said officials.
, 
, The only other taluka to see a rise in HIV numbers this year is Ponda-two up from 26 recorded last year. Most of the other 11 talukas have seen declines.
, 
, Commenting on Canacona's rise in numbers, GSACS project director Dr , said the tourist-centric beaches in the taluka-Palolem and Galgibaga-could have contributed to the overall numbers. The coastal belts of the state have always been considered very vulnerable to the virus.
, 
, Remarkable declines in numbers were recorded in Salcete (52; down 34 from last year's 86), Mormugao (77; down 37 from last year's 114), Tiswadi (33; down 26 from 59), Quepem (10; down nine from 19) and Pernem (4; down seven from 11). Dips were also seen in Bicholim (14; down four from last year's 18), Sanguem (12; down four from 16) and Sattari (14; down one from 15).

, 
, Eighty-one persons-57 men, 23 , and a transgender person-succumbed to AIDS between January and September 2012 as against 90 who died between January and December 2011.
, 
, Commenting on this, Desai said, ""HIV takes several years to turn into full-blown AIDS. Those who died would have contracted the virus seven to eight years ago."" She added that up to October this year 486 people have tested positive for HIV, while 76 are currently living with AIDS.
, 
, Desai stressed that HIV cases have been on a decline in Goa for the last four years. While around 1,019 persons contracted the virus in 2008, the numbers dropped to 959 in 2009, 821 in 2010 and 665 in 2011. Of these 105 HIV-infected persons developed AIDS in 2008, 184 in 2009, 154 in 2010 and 106 in 2011.
, 
, Stating that GSACS has so far tested the blood samples of just 3,62,414 people for HIV (the state's population is over 15 lakh), the project director said there could be more people with HIV in Goa.
, 
, ""We work with high-risk groups that include commercial sex workers, and men who have sex with men. While most have tested for the virus, there may be some who have not come forward to test themselves,"" said Desai.
, 
, She added, ""Besides, there may be some people who have done their blood tests at private laboratories. These laboratories do not provide their data to GSACS and their figures are therefore not on record.""

, ""My world came crumbling down for the second time when we both tested positive for HIV. My son became really ill in 2004. But Dr Subhashis Bhattacharya, who works at the apex clinic in Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, came as a godsend. He not only helped us with the treatment but supported us mentally through counseling. He made us believe that AIDS is not the end of the world,"" Aruna told TOI.
, 
, Aruna's elder brother and parents stood rock solid behind her. Aruna, who is a science graduate, gives private tuition to fund his son's education. Debaditya is preparing for his Class X board examination. ""I am very positive about life. Come what may, I do not let HIV affect my life. But I do not want my friends to come to know about it as the infection is still a taboo for many. I only wish no one gets the infection for none of their fault,"" Debaditya said.
, 
, ""The amount of grit and courage Aruna has is incredible. In spite of being HIV-positive, she is not only bringing up her HIV-positive son single-handedly, but is also ensuring good education for him,"" said Dr Bhattacharya, a paediatric HIV specialist with NACO.
, 
, Aruna and Debaditya are getting their anti-retroviral therapy free of cost, but she is concerned for her son's future. Often she has to seek financial help from NGOs for his education. ""The expenses of my son's education will only grow as he graduates into higher class. My earning through private tuitions is too meagre and irregular at times. I want a job but I do not know who would offer me one. Also will any organisation give me a job if they know my HIV status?"" wondered Aruna.
, 
, While teaching the chapter on HIV in biology Aruna does not forget to tell her students never to indulge in unprotected sex. ""I make it a point to stress upon the fact that none should have unprotected sex as it is a major source for HIV transmission. I do not want anyone to undergo the hardship I am going through. I can fight but not everyone might have the strength to do so,"" she added.

Further, the number of children and adults undergoing ART doubled between January 2010 and 2012. , (GSACS) officials said this was because of increased surveillance and more nodal centres.

, The new HIV estimates released by Union health minister , on the eve of , show Maharashtra remains a hotbed for HIV infection among high-risk groups and the prevalence rate is much higher than the national average.
, 
, According to the recently concluded HIV Sentinel Surveillance 2010-11, national prevalence among adults (15-49 years) dipped to 0.27% but the positivity in the state hovered around 0.42%.
, 
, In fact, Maharashtra, with six other states, accounted for 31% new infections in the two years since the previous study. Agencies working for HIV prevention in the state attributed the high prevalence to migration.
, 
, Project director of , (MSACS) Ramesh Devkar said: “While more people are approaching care centres, migration is one of the main causes why we continue to remain a hotbed.”
, 
, The state has come off as the worst for HIV among female sex workers (FSW) with prevalence at 6.89% against a national average of 2.67%. Devkar pointed out that prevalence was around 11% two years ago, arguing that the state is improving.

, Experts say Mumbai plays a huge role. Though there is no official confirmation, the prevalence of HIV among MSM in the city is believed to be above 12%. Worse, among transgenders, the prevalence stands at an astounding 18.80%.
, 
, For intravenous drug users, the state average for HIV/AIDS prevalence stood at 14.17%, double the national average of 7.14%. Overall, reduction in HIV cases among IDUs at the national level has not been significant. It has dipped from 7.23% in 2007 to 7.14% in 2011.

"Nov 29, 2012, 03:01 IST",Global CEOs seek removal of travel ban on HIV positive people,"NEW DELHI: Some of the world’s most powerful CEOs have now joined hands to bring down repressive laws by around 45 countries that still deport, detain or deny entry to people solely because they are living with HIV. 

, Days after TOI reported how 45 countries — many of them major hubs for international business -- still ban travel of HIV infected patients, more than 40 CEOs who represent nearly 2 million employees from companies like Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola, Pfizer, Heineken, Merck, the National Basketball Association and Thomson Reuters signed an unprecedented pledge urging the repeal of laws and policies in these countries that restrict movement of , patients. 
,
, The CEOs said they opposed HIV travel restrictions because they were discriminatory and because to succeed in today’s globalized economy, companies must be able to send their employees and best talent overseas, regardless of their HIV status. 
,
, “It’s time to send HIV travel restrictions packing,” said Kenneth Cole, CEO of Kenneth Cole Productions. “Using our collective might, I believe we can use our influence to eliminate these discriminatory practices.” 
,
, The US lifted its 22-year HIV travel ban in 2010. Other countries, including Armenia, China, Fiji, Moldova, Namibia and Ukraine have also recently removed such restrictions. 
,
, “Travel restrictions on individuals with HIV are unnecessary and hinder the ability for individuals and companies to operate in a truly global workforce,” said Mark Bertolini, chairman and CEO of Aetna. 
,
, Most HIV-travel restrictions were imposed by governments in the 1980s when little was known about the transmission of HIV, and treatment didn’t exist. “Since then, we’ve learned how to effectively prevent, manage and treat HIV,” , said. 
,
, “Restrictions on entry, stay and residence for people living with HIV are discriminatory and a violation of human rights,” said Michel Sidibé, executive director of UNAIDS. “Every individual should have equal access to freedom of movement. I urge all countries to remove all such restrictions based on HIV status,” he added. 
,
, “HIV travel restrictions are discriminatory and bad for business,” said Chip Bergh, president of Levi Strauss & Co. 
,
, There is a blanket ban on entry of people living with HIV in five countries — Brunei Darussalam, Oman, Sudan, UAE and Yemen. Five countries -- Egypt, Singapore, Iraq, Qatar and Turks and Caicos Islands -- require individuals wishing to stay for short periods (10–90 days) to prove that they are HIV-negative. 
,
, Laws in 20 countries including Malaysia, Russia, Singapore, Jordan and Kuwait deport individuals discovered to be living with HIV. 
,
, Even in the epidemic’s fourth decade globally, nearly 4 in 10 countries worldwide still lack any specific legal provisions to prevent or address HIV-related discrimination. 
,
, The Global AIDS Epidemic 2012 report, released by UNAIDS, says that the effects of such restrictions are most severe for migrant workers, who play an increasingly prominent role in the global economy. From 2005 to 2010, the number of international migrants rose from 191 million to 214 million. The report says that the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council – Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE – all mandatorily test people seeking to come to the Gulf countries to work and require them to be periodically tested to renew visas. 
,
, “Those who become HIV-positive while working in the Gulf are often quarantined, deported, denied appropriate health care and ostracized upon returning to their home countries. Migrants’ HIV-positive test results are shared with all approved medical centres in the Gulf Cooperation Council, with such workers categorized as permanently unfit to enter any Gulf Cooperation Council country in the future,” the report said. 
,
, India lifted all travel restrictions against HIV-positive patients in 2010. 
,
, In 2002, the health ministry had issued a notification stating that mandatory test for HIV for India-bound foreign nationals should be removed from visa forms. However, some embassies failed to enforce it and continued to display the requirement of HIV test certificate on their websites as well as on visa forms. 
,
, On September 17, 2010 the ministry of external affairs clarified that there were no travel or residency restrictions for people living with HIV coming to India.

,
, “We have the drugs to do that. It’s really about delivering them in a way that makes them more potent , and allows a woman to want to use it,” Woodrow said. “This method allows controlled release of multiple compounds. We were able to tune the fibres to have different release properties ,” co-author Cameron Ball said.

,
, “I have been coming here to teach music to these children for the last three years,” said Ravi Verma, who has recently composed music for a Tamilmovie, Mayil Parai, which is slated to release next month. “Instead of regular vocal music, I have been teaching them to approach music like a composer. It’s wonderful to see the kind of compositions that they come up with. Generally, many people trained in music may be good at vocals or instruments, but cannot really compose as they have not been taught to think that way.

""I live in Mumbai while my mother lives in Azamgarh district in Uttar Pradesh. We went back and forth several times in this period to get the paperwork done,'' he said.

As per the transplant Act, this is a familial transplant and doesn't require any no-objection certificate,'' said Dr Rushi Deshpande, who is Singh's nephrologist. But Maharashtra government rules require an NOC even in case of families when the donor is from outside the state. In fact, the matter is being heard by the Bombay high court following a petition filed by a nephrologist protesting against this rule.
, 
, ""The hospital had told us five months back that my husband is healthy enough to undergo a transplant, but the paperwork delayed us immensely,'' said Singh's wife. She was particularly worried about his counts falling due to his , status. ""Even though his HIV specialist Dr J K Maniar managed to keep his counts well, it was difficult for us to find a hospital that was willing to conduct his dialysis.

The city has recorded a remarkable dip in the number of cross-infections and the success has been attributed to early detection and awareness.
 
, HIV, per se, does not kill but rather makes the body vulnerable to opportunistic infections by lowering immunity. Tuberculosis takes the top spot as the biggest opportunistic infection and killer among HIV patients. Statistics compiled by the , (MDACS) has revealed how in the last six years the incidence of tuberculosis in HIV suspects has halved. If 15% of patients who walked in for HIV testing in 2007 were found to be suffering from TB, it came down to 7% till last year. The same trend has been witnessed in those suffering from tuberculosis. TB patients remain highly vulnerable to HIV as global numbers suggest that around 13-14% end up contracting the bacterial infection. Here too, the MDACS records show that significant improvement has been made. From an incidence of 10% TB patients contracting HIV, the percentage has come down to 3% and remained there in the last two years. Additional project director of MDACS Dr Balkrishna Adsul said increased awareness among both set of patients could be one of the main reasons.

, Deserted by his wife, Tariq is now looked after by his two brothers. He has not been able to work for the last six months. ""With each passing month, he has been getting weaker. As if the HIV was not bad enough, he got oral cancer six months ago. The pain has been excruciating and he has barely been able to eat. But the treatment at the government hospitals was shocking. They just refused to treat him,"" said Mohammed Moin, his brother-in-law.
, 
, RG Kar authorities, on the other hand, argued that HIV-positive patients are often asked to continue treatment for the virus when they seek redress for another ailment.
, 
, ""As the rules say, HIV patients are treated on a par with others. We are not permitted to disclose their HIV status even to the hospital staff. But we must handle them carefully, for they are carrying a contagious virus. So, we often advise them to make sure that they continue their treatment for HIV and are referred to our HIV centre. Strangely, patients often take this as refusal. I am not aware of Tariq's case, but it seems unlikely that he was shooed away just because he had the disease. At any given point of time, RG Kar has at least 8 to 10 HIV patients who are being treated alongside the rest,"" said Ajoy Ray, medical superintendent of RG Kar.

, The government introduced free bus travel for HIV positive patients three months ago. Once in a month, the dependents of those below 18 and above 60 can also travel free in buses to ART centres to buy medicines.
, 
, In the past three years, the HIV positive cases have come down in both pregnant women and the public.
, 
, Among 75,424 tested pregnant women, 457 tested positive in the period April 2009 to March 2010 while in April 2010 to March 2011, among 73,118 women tested, 312 cases were found positive. In the period April 2011 to March 2012, 1,23,857 women underwent HIV test, and 262 were found positive while during April 2012 to February 2013, 82,613 were tested and 167 found positive.

, 
, Dr Balakrishna N Tukkar of District ,, Belgaum district, said: ""Thanks to awareness, pregnant women come voluntarily for the test now, which was not the case six to seven years back. With the help of central and state governments and with the support from NGOs, we conducted various awareness programmes like street plays, counselling of sex workers and competitions in schools and colleges. Once the patients are tested HIV positive, we conduct pre- and post- counselling. There are five ART centres in Belgaum district, each in Belgaum, Savadatti, Chikkodi, Athani and Gokak taluk. Patiensts are given free tablets at these centres.''
, 
, He added: ""After the government launched the Parent to Children Transmission Programme in 2006, the number of children succumbing to HIV positive due to mother has come down drastically. Under this programme, anti-retroviral tablets are given to pregnant women who are tested HIV positive from their fourth month of pregnancy. Through this, even if a mother is HIV positive, the baby will not get it.''
, 
, The NGOs also play a pivotal role. They keep track of the patients. If they discontinue tablets, they counsel them and get them to ART Centre and give the tablets.

"Updated: Apr 26, 2013, 05:32 IST","Court equates HIV+ with venereal disease, grants man divorce","MADURAI: In a landmark order, the , of the , has granted divorce to a man on the ground that his wife was ,, equating the condition to a venereal disease.
 
,
, “When a spouse is HIV-positive, the other spouse is entitled for divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act,” Justice R S Ramanathan ruled last week. Passing orders on the appeal filed by lorry driver P Ravikumar, the judge said that in 1955 when the , came into existence, HIV was not heard of. However, as per Section 13(v) of the Act if a spouse is suffering from a venereal disease in a communicable form, it is a valid ground for divorce, he said. 
,
, Justice Ramanathan, noting that he had perused materials available on the internet, concluded that HIV infection being a communicable health hazard, a person testing positive for the virus should be considered an acceptable ground for divorce. 
,
, “In the year 1955, HIV was not heard of and, therefore, it was not named in the Hindu Marriage Act as one of the grounds for dissolution of marriage. But having regard for the fact that venereal disease in a communicable form has been mentioned as one of the grounds for divorce, any such disease will also come under the provision of , 13(v). Therefore, it cannot be contended that HIV-positive condition is not included under the section and therefore divorce cannot be granted,” Justice Ramanathan said. 
,
, The matter relates to the matrimonial dispute between the couple from Sankagiri in Salem district. On an application from Ravikumar, a sub-court dissolved their marriage on April 3, 2007. However, hearing the appeal filed by his wife, the additional district court in Salem on January 31, 2008 ruled that divorce cannot be granted. Ravikumar then approached the high court. 
,
, When the matter was taken up for hearing, his wife’s counsel denied that she was HIV-positive and argued that since her husband was a driver visiting various places during his duty, if at all she is afflicted with HIV, she must have got it only through her husband. While the Hindu Marriage Act had specifically stated that venereal diseases in a communicable form could be a ground for divorce, it had not said anywhere that HIV-positive condition could be a ground for dissolution of a marriage. The divorce plea of Ravikumar, therefore, is not maintainable, she submitted. 
,
, However, when the court asked the couple to undergo tests at the Government , in Chennai, Ravikumar alone complied with the order. His wife refused to undergo any tests voluntarily, despite two directives from the court.

, A team of researchers from the , have announced that they have peeled open ,'s outer coating and discovered 4-million-atom structure inside the protein shell.
, 
, The findings, researchers say will ultimately lead the way to fending off an often-changing virus that has been very hard to conquer.
, 
, It's been 30 years since the AIDS epidemic spread to every corner of the world killing nearly 30 million people, infecting more than 60 million. There is still no vaccine or cure for it
, 
, Scientists say developing an effective vaccine to prevent HIV infection is one of the most daunting challenges ever faced. One of the main reason for this is that HIV is an incredibly elusive virus.
, 
, HIV is among the most mutating viruses.
, 
, Scientists have long struggled to decipher how the HIV capsid shell is chemically put together.
, 
, Senior author Peijun Zhang, department of structural biology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine said, ""The capsid is critically important for ,, so knowing its structure in detail could lead us to new drugs that can treat or prevent the infection,"" she said.
, 
, ""This approach has the potential to be a powerful alternative to our current HIV therapies, which work by targeting certain enzymes, but drug resistance is an enormous challenge due to the virus' high mutation rate.""
, 
, Previous research has shown that the cone-shaped shell is composed of identical capsid proteins linked together in a complex lattice.
, 
, But the shell is non-uniform and asymmetrical; uncertainty remained about the exact number of proteins involved and how the hexagons of six protein subunits and pentagons of five subunits are joined.
, 
, Standard structural biology methods to decipher the molecular architecture were insufficient because they rely on averaged data, collected on samples of pieces of the highly variable capsid to identify how these pieces tend to go together.
, 
, ""The capsid is very sensitive to mutation, so if we can disrupt those interfaces, we could interfere with capsid function,"" Dr Zhang said. ""The capsid has to remain intact to protect the HIV genome and get it into the human cell, but once inside it has to come apart to release its content so that the virus can replicate. Developing drugs that cause capsid dysfunction by preventing its assembly or disassembly might stop the virus from reproducing.""
, 
, ""By using a combination of experimental and computational approaches, this team of investigators has produced a clearer picture of the structure of HIV's protective covering,"" said the National Institutes of Health's Michael Sakalian.
, 
, ""The new structural details may reveal vulnerabilities that could be exploited by future therapeutics.""

The scheme was launched by the department of health and family welfare and Karnataka State Aids Prevention Society (KSAPS) in January 2013.
 
,
, Before the launch of this scheme, many poor HIV patients, mainly those residing in rural areas, did not visit ART centres regularly for treatment as they couldn’t afford the travel fare from their homes to the centres. Six ART centres are situated in different parts of DK district, including two centres in Mangalore city. Dr Kishore Kumar, DK district AIDS control officer, told TOI that an average of 60 HIV patients visit each ART centre a day for treatment. There are 1,600 patients registered in ART centres which provide free treatment, he said. 
,
, Before the travel fare reimbursement fee scheme was introduced, around 20 patients were skipping their regular visits to ART centres every day. But in the past few months, this number has come down to three, he added. 
,
, “Last year, when we contacted patients about why they weren’t visiting ART centres, they’d say they cannot afford the travel expense,” said Dr Kishore. He said patients who travel from rural areas to ART centres are reimbursed 80 paisa per kilometre to and fro, while patients within city limits are given Rs 40.

, ""He was attended immediately by our doctors. But the patient had lost so much of blood and the injury was so grievous that he could not revived. He succumbed to the injury about an hour later,"" said Dr Pradip Kumar Kundu, STM medical superintendent and vice principal.
, 
, The patient was detected HIV positive a couple of years ago. He was on ART drugs for about eight months from Medical College and Hospital Calcutta. But due to his irregularities in going for the ART his CD 4 count had come down drastically as a result he was rushed to the said hospital about a month ago. He was then discharged after being treated for about a week. His family brought him to STM two weeks ago as he had become anaemic and suffered from bouts of diarrhoea.
, 
, Family members said that the patient would skip medications if he was not monitored by someone. That is how his son stayed with him in the hospital to look after him. Doctors treating him also said that the patient was depressed and was also suffering from dementia. His condition had started improving slightly in the past one week.
, 
, A knife brought by the son to cut fruit for the patient was used to cut open the abdomen of the patient. Police suspects that he was unable to bear with sufferings and hence took his own life.
, 
, ""The nature of injury appears to be self inflicted and hence it looks like a case of suicide. However whether it was suicide or homicide will be confirmed once we get the autopsy report,"" said a senior police officer of the detective department.

"Jun 12, 2013, 06:08 IST",Chennai-Yale study pitches for universal HIV test to cut cost,"LONDON: Testing every person in India’s billion plus population for HIV will be cost effective, the first ever study on the benefit of universal HIV testing has found. 

, A team of researchers from YRG Care in Chennai, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Brown, Yale and Harvard universities in the US has determined that providing universal HIV testing every five years would be a cost-effective approach to managing the epidemic. The finding was published on Tuesday in the journal PLoS One. 
,
, Testing the general population just once would cost $1,100 (approx 65,000) per year of life saved (YLS) in the general population, and $800 (47,000) per YLS among high-risk groups. Testing the population every five years would cost $1,900 (1.1lakh) per YLS saved in for the general public, and $1,300 (76,000) per YLS among high-risk groups. 
,
, Researchers said the main benefit of national testing would be getting more people to learn they are positive and therefore to seek effective care. A secondary benefit would be to curb transmission of the virus. 
,
, According to the team, the main results are projections of the dollar cost per year of extended life. The World Health Organization’s standard for cost effectiveness is an expenditure that is less than three times the per capita GDP of a country. 
,
, In India in 2010, per capita GDP was $1,300. A programme is therefore cost-effective in India if the expense is less than $3,900 (2.2lakh) to save a year of someone’s life. 
,
, They calculated that modern antiretroviral therapies can give HIV-positive people a normal lifespan. In India, which has a thriving generic pharmaceutical sector, first-line therapy costs only $8.61 (500) a month. HIV tests cost only $3.33 (195). 
,
, The team coded several other parameters into the model including what percentage of people would refuse the test (18%), how many patients who test positive would get care (50%), the prevalence of HIV in the population (0.29%) and others. 
,
, Jessica Becker of Yale University said, “We were able to show that even if you increase the cost of HIV treatment and care significantly, testing this frequently was reasonable.” 
,
, Co-author Dr Soumya Swaminathan, director of the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis in Chennai, said the projections will help the country in its battle with the epidemic. 
,
, “As India moves ahead in its HIV prevention activities and aims for zero new infections, expanding testing will be a priority and this analysis should help policymakers make the best decisions,” she said.

Artificial insemination methods like intra uterine insemination where the sperm is laboratory washed is used. IVF can also be done but is still not very popular.

, The union ministry for health and the family welfare department along with , Aids Control Organization (NACO) formed an expert committee to look into the issue. This was on the basis of a Gujarat High Court order passed on November 8 last year in a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) demanding that the PCR test or the Nucleic Acid Amblification Test (NAAT) should be made mandatory in lieu of Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (,) for detection of HIV infection. The PIL argued that the PCR test reduces the 'window period,' that is, the time period the body takes to produce antibodies in response to HIV infection, also the time period during which the HIV virus is undetectable.
, 
, The committee was asked to recommend the extent to which PCR test should be made mandatory at all licensed blood banks. It submitted its report on Thursday with conclusions and recommendations.
, 
, The committee has concluded that the NAAT can at best be an add-on test of HIV screening along with routine mandated antibody screening tests by immunoassay. NAAT is technically demanding and our blood banks are not adequately equipped to carry it out for routine purposes. It also said that NAAT assays may not provide zero risk for acquiring transfusion transmitted infections (TTI) as it does not completely eliminate the window period.
, 
, After listing out eight reasons why PCR cannot be made mandatory in India, the experts recommended that it should not be made compulsory for all blood banks, since the high turnaround time in screening donated blood may lead to a delay in utilization and may compromise accessibility of blood and blood components. Moreover, its introduction would necessitate amendment in the regulatory framework.
, 
, The expert group further opined that since there is insufficient data on the additional yield of TTI viral markers as well as operational and technical feasibility in India, selected centres may be identified to conduct this test.

The UP State Aids Control Society (UPSACS) has now launched an extensive educational and awareness campaign with special attention on migrants.
 
, This extensive drive has been launched after five districts of UP including Allahabad, Mau, Deoria, Etawah and Banda were placed under 'category A' in terms of migration of , infected persons. Subsequently NACO is carrying out a special campaign in identified villages between June 13 and 27.
, 
, NACO has also decided to carry out fourth phase of AIDS control programme in UP from October this year. According to the report, a total of 183 districts across the nation have been placed under 'category A' by NACO.
, 
, Nodal officer, DAPCU, Dr OP Shahi told TOI that ""We have been carrying out extensive awareness campaign through 'folk art' to capture people's attention. Folk art like nukkad natak, nautanki, magic show, puppetry and kabbali are the best source of spreading awareness among people.""
, 
, He further added that under the first phase, awareness and educational camps will be held in 100 villages while remaining villages would be covered under the second phase.
, 
, Dr Rohit Pandey, district programme manager, AIDS programme said that special camps are being held in 100 identified villages from June 13 to 27 while mass awareness camps in the same villages would be held between June 20 and July 4, 2013. He added that five villages each from 20 blocks of the district have been selected for awareness and educational progammes wherein migrants are being apprised about it too. Even as the officials will be collecting data of number patients from all 20 blocks of the district, they will also be carrying out an intensive drive to check the health status of migrants and identify their locations with an aim to offer them counseling and treatment. Meanwhile, they will also be conducting studies regarding the migration pattern and prevalence of HIV.
, 
, As far as route of infection and transmission categories are concerned, in 85.3 per cent cases, the disease spreads due to unsafe sexual contact, while 3.80 per cent, 2.05 per cent, 3.34 per cent and 6.46 per cent cases are due to prenatal transmission, blood transfusion, injectable drug users respectively.
, 
, Dr Shahi claimed under the directives of NACO and UPACS, district health authorities will be identifying those migrant labourers, truckers and homosexuals in the district as they are more vulnerable to the disease. Officials are also mapping high-risk groups like female sex workers, intravenous drug users and homosexuals, so that concrete measures can be initiated to restrict the , of the virus. UPSACS officials have also been conducting awareness programmes under the information, education and communication (IEC) programme.

The court said it was ""absurd'' for him to say it was in the interest of his wife to go in for early detection.
 
, Justice Roshan Dalvi heard a petition by Santa Cruz resident Joel D'Souza (name changed), who met Joan (name changed) through a marriage bureau. Both professionals, they married on December 26, 2009. In June 2010, Joan had typhoid and went to her mother's place nearby. Thereafter, Joel stopped calling or receiving her calls. On July 7, 2010, he took her call but told her he would not take her back, without explanation. The medical test report of July 7, 2010 confirmed Joan was cured of typhoid and tests included for HIV antibodies.
, 
, On July 10, 2010, on reaching her matrimonial home, she found Joel had changed the lock. On October 22, 2010, he filed for divorce alleging impotency/non-consummation of marriage and cruelty. Pending the petition, on March 16, 2011 Joel filed an application praying for direction to Joan to undergo HIV, TB and hepatitis tests along with tests for impotency/failure to consummate the marriage as he suspected she was HIV positive.
, 
, In his application before the FC, Joel gave many reasons, including fever, tiredness, body ache, dry cough, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and headache. He said Joan had a bloated abdomen although her face, hands and legs were very thin and due to this she wore long outfits. ""On an official website of HIV, it is documented that HIV is medically caused due to accumulation of fat in the stomach,'' he stated. He said she spoke in her sleep using the words 'HIV' and 'AIDS' and mentioned 'Jack Dorsan', who he found on the Internet was in the prostitution business. He said his wife had stored Dorsan's telephone number and spoke to him on the day of their wedding.
, 
, He said she applied lip balm five to six times a day ""as the best treatment for Herpes Simplex Virus is keeping the lips moist"". Joan said Joel's suspicion was ""reckless, wild and cruel'' and he himself needed treatment.
, 
, The FC on May 16, 2012 rejected his application with costs saying, however strong his suspicion, he had to prove the allegations by furnishing evidence so that the court can grant him relief. Joel moved the high court in October 2012.
, 
, Joan's advocate Mini Mathew argued that the July 7, 2010 report confirming she was cured of typhoid was sufficient to hold that it was not necessary to send her for an HIV test. She said Joel had been spreading rumours about her. ""These allegations are stigmatizing. Her reputation is ruined,'' she said.
, 
, Joel's advocate Uday Warunjikar said, ""He caught his wife taking HIV medicines. If she is not suffering from HIV, why is she afraid of the test?'' he asked. Justice Dalvi remarked, ""I doubt the marriage can be reconciled. Both sides must move for an amicable settlement.'' She added, ""Why don't you throw her out in a little respectable way? It will boomerang on you.''

"Updated: Aug 4, 2013, 01:49 IST",'HIV mothers on ARV can breastfeed'," VISAKHAPATNAM: HIV positive mothers can , their newborns provided they are on anti-retroviral therapy (ARV) right through the pregnancy, the delivery and post-delivery period, including the breast-feeding period, to prevent vertical transmission of HIV from mother to child, say medical experts on the occasion of the World Breastfeeding Week that is being celebrated from August 1 to 7 to encourage breastfeeding.
, 
, According to experts, the HIV positive mothers should exclusively breastfeed their children irrespective of HIV status for the first six months while non-infected mothers can breastfeed till the child reaches two years of age.
, 
, ""NACO (National AIDS Control Organisation) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for six months and then soft, nutrient-rich homemade food during the weaning period, preferably upto two years. It has been found that the risk of transmission involved is minimal, just 2%, when the mother is on ARV using a combination drug regime,"" said Dr Jayachandra Reddy, joint director, basic services, AP State Aids Control Society (APSACS).
, 
, ""The child is given nevirapine syrup for six weeks and then septran syrup till the 18th month in case early infant diagnosis or DNA PCR test shows that the child is HIV-negative. In case the child is found to be HIV positive, he or she is put on ARV. WHO (,) recommends alternative or replacement bottle feeding only if five factors are satisfied. These include AFASS - Affordability, Feasibility, Acceptability, Safety and Sustainability,"" said the APSACS official.
, 
, While breast-feeding is recommended for all newborns, there has been controversy over HIV positive mothers breastfeeding their babies but this has now been dispelled with the WHO and doctors dealing with AIDS recommending breastfeeding by HIV positive mothers who are on ARV even in developing countries.
, 
, According to Dr K Surya Rao, specialist in , medicine from Dr Kutikuppala Hospital, one has to weigh the risk and benefits while breastfeeding. ""In India, as per WHO, annually, nearly two-thirds of the over 2.4 million child deaths are related to inappropriate infant feeding practices. Due to lack of breast milk, many infants die of diarrhoea and gastroenteritis overnight. Even though there's some risk of vertical transmission involved, there are ways to prevent it too.""
, 
, ""The mother should be on highly active ARV right from pregnancy, depending on her viral load and take a combination of drugs instead of the earlier practiced mono-therapy. The mother should also be comfortable feeding the child as per requirement. Also, a campaign needs to be undertaken, especially in rural and tribal areas regarding non-discarding the colostrum, which is a component in the mother's first milk containing high protein and antibody and boosts the immune system,"" Dr Rao explained.
, 
, Concurring with experts, Dr Ronanki Ramesh, additional district medical and health officer (AIDS and leprosy) said, ""Mixed feeding with breast and bottle-milk should be avoided to cut down the risk of transmission. Also, in poor or developing countries, , may not have access to safe and affordable replacement feeding options and handling of milk bottles isn't hygienic and triggers more diarrhoea deaths in infants. Therefore, irrespective of the HIV status, mothers on ARV are encouraged to breastfeed their children within one hour of birth.""
, 
, According to doctors, breastfeeding is the best way to provide ideal food for the healthy growth and development of infants as apart from creating immunity and protecting the baby from infections, it also creates a special bond between the mother and child.

"Updated: Jul 31, 2013, 04:43 IST,Funded through European Union and Christian Aid, the project aims to contribute to the National Aids Control P... ",HIV positive women turn changemakers," NEW DELHI: For several years, Asha Jat was just a 27-year-old homemaker from Ajmer who had tested , and was shunned by society. Then four years ago, she was introduced to a health project that helps HIV positive mothers avail medical assistance for themselves and their child. Now Asha is one of the 25 volunteers for the project in Rajasthan's Ajmer district and has facilitated 102 childbirths of HIV positive women in the last four years.
, 
, The project titled, Reduction of Parent to Child Transmission of HIV in India: Improving access of Positive Women to Public Health Services (,), was launched in three states — Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan in 2009. ""The project taught me to speak for myself and stand up for my rights,"" says Asha.
, 
, Funded through European Union and Christian Aid, the project aims to contribute to the National Aids Control Programme—III's overall goal of halting and reversing the HIV epidemic in India. This was to be achieved by providing non–stigmatized PPTCT services through networks and volunteers.
, 
, According to Asha, before the PPTCT project, women were neither able to access government health services nor opted for hospital deliveries. After the programme began, there has been a definite increase in both accessing services and hospital deliveries. ""More importantly there has been a drop in the number of children that are born HIV positive,"" says Asha, who shared her experiences at a round table meeting in the capital on Tuesday.
, 
, District government doctors give lists of HIV positive people to PPTCT volunteers to follow-up. ""The project enables a woman or mothers to go to heath services and say ""I am HIV+, my child is negative and I need medical assistance,"" said Akhila Sivdas, executive director, Centre for Advocacy and Research (CFAR) that advocates for informed representation about gender and development issues such as HIV/AIDS, child rights and violence against marginalised groups.
, 
, The PPTCT project was implemented by the Positive Women's Network (PWN+), a Tamil Nadu Voluntary Health Association (TNVHA), Arogya Agam, Tamil Nadu and Society for People's Action for Development (SPAD), Karnataka.
, 
, According to Padmavati, president (PWN+) Tamil Nadu, the project is making a big difference in tribal districts such as Nilgris, Theni and Coimbatore. ""In those places the volunteers are literally the lynchpins of the programme. Every village has a volunteer network and the women, though they don't get an honorarium, are happy to work as volunteers because they have had positive children themselves and they do not want others to go through the same experience"".
, 
, Citing a highpoint of the programme, Padmavati described how a volunteer secured 30 ration cards (a necessary document for securing various government healthcare facilities) from the Coimbatore collector for the HIV+ women of the area in a single day.
, 
, For Gajalaxmi, Sex Workers Collective from Trichi district, the lack of such documents led to sex workers facing discriminations towards their rights and entitlements. ""If other women have to make two-three visits to avail of an entitlement, a sex worker would have to go 10-12 times. Even today 50% of them do not succeed in getting their entitlements,"" she said.
, 
, Tracing the journey undertaken by the Christian Aid, EU and four other civil society organizations in extending PPTCT services to positive women, Semeda Steve, programme manager, Christian Aid maintained that since the programme began the response from HIV positive women has gone up from 7% to 93% in intervention areas.

Hospital staff maintains that despite being referred to Sir Sundar Lal (SSL) Hospital, , (,), Ram was staying the ward on his free will.
, 
, Hospital administration is also unable to clarify as to why the patient, who is unable to travel on his own, has not been provided with the ambulance facility for shifting to SSL. Ram has a severe infection in his leg and is unable to move even from his bed. Forty-year-old Ram, who is being nursed by his old mother, says, ""We cannot go to SSL. We have no money or strength to travel."" He had earlier alleged that hospital staff was discriminating against him in providing medical care. He had claimed that the para-medical staff had refused to clean his wound and dress it properly. As a result, her mother was acting as his nurse. The para-medics had claimed that Ram's case was different as he was suffering from HIV infection. ""HIV positive patients have to be attended in a different manner. We don't have any arrangement for taking care of such a patient, hence we are unable to take care of his wound,"" said para-medic Saikhu.
, 
, The hospital's attitude towards Ram is indicative of the stigma and lack of awareness among the hospital staff regarding HIV. The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has clear guidelines that HIV AIDS patients are to be treated at par with general patients and without discrimination. It also does not support any separate ward for these patients. The hospital's silence over not offering any assistance in shifting the patient to BHU is also a major issue.
, 
, Meanwhile, taking serious note of the reports of discrimination against HIV positive patient, National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has sought a report from the Shiv Prasad Gupta (SPG) Divisional Hospital on the issue. Through a letter, the NACO has ordered officials concerned to probe into the matter and submit a report within a week.
, 
, Accepting that such a letter has been received by the hospital administration, superintendent-in-chief (SIC), SPG Hospital, Dr VK Srivastava said, ""The patient is staying in the hospital on his own free will. He is not ready to shift to the BHU. We have already informed the CMO and the police about it. The hospital staff has never discriminated against the patient. We will submit a report to NACO by Friday.""

, Meanwhile, the 'Banaras Network for Positive People Living with HIV' a non-profit organisation run by HIV positive people has also taken the matter seriously.

But now even the common population will be brought in its ambit and free HIV card test will be made available in the remotest PHCs in state. The HIV test, apart from 14 other tests, will be provided free-of-cost at all PHCs from April 15 under the chief minister free diagnostic test scheme phase III.

, 
, According to the recently-released HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS), the prevalence of HIV in state increased from 0.19% in 2008-09 to 0.38 in 2011-12. Rajasthan is a low prevalence state but is highly vulnerable due to the presence of high risk groups including female sex workers, injectable drug users, truckers and labourers.
, 
, , (RSACS) project director Dr SS Chauhan said, ""Earlier, National Aids Control Organization (NACO) and RSACS provided free test to high risk groups only.

"Updated: Sep 20, 2013, 15:02 IST",New molecule design prompts HIV to kill itself,"WASHINGTON: , in suicide mode! In a breakthrough, researchers, including an Indian-origin scientist, have created a , that can trick HIV into killing itself without disturbing any healthy cells. 

, Pinning down an effective way to combat the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus, the viral precursor to AIDS, has long been a challenge for scientists and physicians, because the virus is an elusive one that mutates frequently and, as a result, quickly becomes immune to medication. 
,
, A team of , researchers is trying to get one step ahead of the virus with a microbicide they've created that can trick HIV into ""popping"" itself into oblivion. 
,
, The microbicide DAVEI - which stands for ""Dual Action Virolytic Entry Inhibitor"" - is the latest in a new generation of HIV treatments that function by specifically destroying the virus without harming healthy cells, researchers said. 
,
, ""While several molecules that destroy HIV have recently been announced, DAVEI is unique among them by virtue of its design, specificity and high potency,"" said Dr Cameron Abrams, a professor in Drexel's College of Engineering and a primary investigator of the project. 
,
, A team co-led by Abrams and Dr Irwin Chaiken in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in Drexel's College of Medicine, and including R V Kalyana Sundaram, developed the chimeric recombinantly engineered protein - that is, a molecule assembled from pieces of other molecules and engineered for a specific purpose, in this case to fight HIV. 
,
, HIV invades a healthy cell by first attaching via protein ""spikes"" that then collapse to pull viral and cell membranes together, fusing them and allowing the genetic contents of the virus to enter the healthy cell. 
,
, The cell is rewired by the viral genetic material into producing more viruses instead of performing its normal function, which, in the case of cells infected by HIV, involves normal immunity. AIDS is the result. 
,
, ""We hypothesised that an important role of the fusion machinery is to open the viral membrane when triggered, and it follows that a trigger didn't necessarily have to be a doomed cell,"" Abrams said. 
,
, ""So we envisioned particular ways the components of the viral fusion machinery work and designed a molecule that would trigger it prematurely,"" Abrams said. 
,
, The team designed DAVEI from two main ingredients. One piece, called the Membrane Proximal External Region (MPER), is itself a small piece of the fusion machinery and interacts strongly with viral membranes. 
,
, The other piece, called cyanovirin, binds to the sugar coating of the protein spike. Working together, the MPER and cyanovirin in DAVEI ""tweak"" the fusion machinery in a way that mimics the forces it feels when attached to a cell. 
,
, The study was published in the journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy.

, Heena (name changed to protect identity), who was suffering from urinary tract infection was taken to , on September 2. After allegedly waiting for about a week for admission, the 24-year-old was finally taken away by the community members on Tuesday. Last heard, she was on her way to a place in Bihar for 'treatment' by quacks.
, 
, Heena's fault was that she got castrated in February this year somewhere in Bihar by 'professionals' in the community. Heena was also detected to be HIV-positive about a couple of months back. With no encouragement from the community to go to a hospital, Heena was treated by quacks for a few weeks. But when her condition deteriorated, she sought the help of Association of Trangenders and Hijras in Bengal (ATHB).
, 
, After running from one official to another at SSKM, Heena was asked to come to the hospital on September 9. She was checked by doctors of the urology department on September 9 and advised admission. But the hospital authority said since Heena had undergone castration, she needed an order from a district judge for admission.
, 
, ""We had no knowledge of this formality. They kept insisting that we get this order from a district judge. How could the patient get it when she herself was unable to move because of the ailment? We were worried about her condition,"" said ATHB secretary Ranjita Sinha.
, 
, Heena's cries of pain fell on deaf ears as the hospital allegedly kept citing the legal issues. Aggravating the problem was the absence of a separate ward for the third sex. Even as some doctors were sympathetic, they too pleaded helplessness. The hospital also told them that a relative had to sign a risk bond in case admission was granted. Since Heena has no family, her 'hirja gurus' were convinced by ATHB to sign the bond. Accordingly, some from the community came to the hospital. But seeing the delay and the apathy, they took Heena away and she left for Bihar on Wednesday morning.
, 
, In the meantime, ATHB members sought the intervention of the West Bengal State AIDs Prevention and Control Society (WBSAPCS). While some officials claimed that they were talking to hospital authorities; some pleaded that they were out of station.
, 
, ""Some people from the eunuch community who had come to the hospital were getting impatient. They were pained by the way Heena was suffering. They lamented that they had no place in the society, even in hospitals. Despite our plea to wait for another day, they took Heena away,"" said Sinha.
, 
, Heena is probably getting 'treatment' right now from quacks somewhere in Bihar. None from SSKM wanted to comment on the allegation. Dr D N Goswami, joint director (TI), who was constantly informed about the problem, also refused to comment saying that he was busy in a meeting. Other WBSAPCS officials, however, said they would look into the issue.

The hospital administration has also 'instructed' the blood bank officials to provide blood to such patients without asking for replacement blood.
, 
, PMCH's deputy superintendent Dr Bimal Karak said, ""Operation on HIV+ patients are performed as per the requirement. I have now proposed that such patients be operated every Saturday, so that other operations are not affected. An OT has to be fumigated for 24 hours after operating an HIV patient and it can't be used for that duration. The hospital superintendent will take a final call on this proposal.""
, 
, To remove doctors' reservation over operating on such patients, safety kits have already been provided to all the departments. If a doctor gets a nick during the operation, certain medicines have also been provided to undo its effect, Dr Karak said.
, 
, He added, ""The state government's order to give blood to HIV+ patients without replacement blood has been implemented with immediate effect."" It will be the duty of the medical officer concerned to see that the blood supplied by the blood bank is given to the patient before its expiry period of five hours. This will ensure that the blood is not wasted, said Dr Karak.
, 
, It may be mentioned here that the attendants of a 45-year-old HIV+ woman, who died in PMCH on September 9, had alleged that they could not get blood on time despite being ready to provide replacement blood. The doctors treating the woman had also said that the woman required urgent transfusion of blood.
, 
, The blood bank's chief medical officer, Dr U P Singh, claimed this instruction was being followed even earlier. Asked why was that woman then denied blood, he said, ""I didn't see the woman's prescription which said that she was HIV positive. Had I known it, replacement blood would not have been demanded.""

But, thanks to the exclusive legal aid centre at ART centre in Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH). The centre has so far dealt with 137 cases related to injustice done to patients infected with HIV, who are mostly women. 

, Since its inauguration in April 2010, the legal aid centre has so far handled 153 cases including 78 male and 75 female cases related to various types of discrimination against people infected with HIV. Around 137 cases have been solved outside the court. For instance, a 33-year-old man from Palakkarai in ,, who was tested HIV positive after his marriage to a 24-year-old woman in Pudukkottai, died in January 2012. Since her husband succumbed to HIV, the family of her husband harassed her in order to chase her away from them.
, 
, Moreover, they denied her a share in their property. The woman was brought to the legal aid centre a few months after her husband's death. The advocate and the counsellor counselled the family members of her husband and explained them about the legal consequences they would face if she was denied of her rights. Only then his family agreed to give her share. Initially they disagreed to give her the share as they were under the impression that their son was infected with HIV because of his wife. But the fact was that she was infected with HIV by her husband. ""We are successfully dealing with the case and trying to get justice. The HIV affected people can approach the legal aid centre for solving their problems. The legal aid centre functions on Tuesday and Friday,"" said advocate ,, who has been dealing with such cases for the past two years. 
,
, In some cases, the family of the husband is withholding the dowry given to the woman. Likewise, many people don't return the money borrowed from the HIV affected person after the death. Such cases have also been dealt. 
,
, ""The families of the husband try to seize the property that should be given to his wife. I have come across some patients who were even denied to use the ration card by the family of her husband. The women, who are already upset after being infected by her husband, can not think of approaching the court. The legal aid centre in the ART centre is a boon for such people as it helps them to get their legal issues solved,"" A Thamil, network for positive people in Trichy, told TOI.

It will also be checked that these people are taking regular medicines through ART centres. At the same time, people who have left the treatment will also be connected by carrying out extensive search and will be put on the treatment once again by giving appropriate counselling to them, he informed. According to Dr Jaya Chakravarty from IMS, around 60% of the HIV patients, who are listed under pre-ART at the ART centre of Sir Sundar Lal (SSL) Hospital, Banaras Hindu University (BHU), do not revert back or turn up for the regular check-up.

"Updated: Sep 27, 2013, 07:12 IST",Antifungal foot cream may help eradicate HIV,"WASHINGTON: In a breakthrough, scientists have discovered that a common drug used to treat nail fungus in feet may permanently eradicate the deadly , from the body. The topical anti-fungal drug , causes HIV infected cells to commit suicide by jamming up the cells’ powerhouse — the ,, researchers said.
 
, Unlike current anti-HIV drugs, Ciclopirox completely eradicates infectious HIV from cell cultures, with no rebound of virus when the drug is stopped, according to researchers at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. The treatment of patients with HIV has been revolutionized by the advent of combination anti-retroviral drugs.
, 
, However, although these drugs are highly effective at keeping HIV at bay, they must be taken for the life of the patient and never eliminate the infection completely . This is illustrated by the often rapid resurgence of virus in patients who stop taking these medications.
, 
, The persistence of HIV is partially due to the ability of the virus to disable the cell's altruistic suicide pathway, which is normally activated when a cell becomes infected or damaged.
, 
, A team of researchers led by Michael Mathews and Hartmut Hanauske-Abel, previously showed that Ciclopirox, commonly used by dermatologists and gynaecologists to treat fungal infections, inhibits the expression of HIV genes in culture. The drug works inhibits the expression of HIV genes and also blocks the essential function of the mitochondria, thereby reactivating the cell’s suicide pathway.
, 
, Healthy, uninfected cells examined during this study were spared. And remarkably, the virus did not bounce back when Ciclopirox was removed, researchers said.
, 
, The utility of Ciclopirox in patients with HIV, for instance after topical application to reduce sexual transmission of the virus, awaits verification in future clinical trials.

, The ring is easy to use, long-lasting, and recently has demonstrated a 100 per cent success rate protecting primates from the simian immunodeficiency virus (SHIV). 
,
, The device will soon undergo its first test in humans, researchers said. 
,
, ""After 10 years of work, we have created an intra-vaginal ring that can prevent against multiple HIV exposures over an extended period of time, with consistent prevention levels throughout the menstrual cycle,"" said Patrick Kiser, an expert in intra-vaginal drug delivery. 
,
, Previous studies have demonstrated that antiviral drugs can prevent HIV infection, but existing methods for delivering the drug fall short. 
,
, Pills must be taken daily and require high doses; vaginal gels that must be applied prior to each sex act are inconvenient, yielding poor usage rates. 
,
, The new ring is easily inserted and stays in place for 30 days. Moreover, because it is delivered at the site of transmission, the ring — known as a TDF-IVR (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate intravaginal ring) — utilizes a smaller dose than pills. 
,
, The device contains powdered tenofovir, an anti-retroviral drug that is taken orally by 3.5 million HIV-infected people worldwide, but that has not previously been studied topically, researchers said. 
,
, The ring's strength stems from its unique polymer construction: its elastomer swells in the presence of fluid, delivering up to 1,000 times more of the drug than current intra-vaginal ring technology, such as NuvaRing, which are made of silicon and have release rates that decline over time. 
,
, The upcoming clinical trial, to be conducted in November at , College of Medicine in New York, will evaluate the ring in 60 women over 14 days. 
,
, The trial will assess the ring's safety and measure how much of the drug is released and the properties of the ring after use. 
,
, Other drugs could potentially be integrated into the ring, such as contraceptives or antiviral drugs to prevent other sexually transmitted infections — a feature that could increase user rates, said Kiser, who joined , from the ,, where the research was conducted.

District health officials have been asked to check the status of migrants living in these villages as they are among the prime carriers of HIV in the district and organize composite health camps.
 
, District Aids Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) officials claim that Allahabad is among 28 districts in the state identified for composite health camps by the NACO and has the largest number of migrant labourers. The composite health check up camps would be held in these villages between Tuesday and November 14.
, 
, The composite health check up would have five specific components, including normal check up and medication; , and sexually transmitted diseases consultation and related counseling/testing and treatment; anti-natal check up of all pregnant women; promotion of condoms-cum-exhibition; and, folk group programmes for awareness.
, 
, Terming migrants as the most susceptible to and responsible for the spread of the fatal disease, nodal officer of DAPCU Dr OP Shahi said “under the directives of NACO and UPACS, efforts are afoot to identify such patients for medication and counselling.” He further said that villages prone to high risk have been placed under the scanner and a series of awareness and educational camps were being undertaken to check the menace.
, 
, DAPCU has already prepared a list of migrants in these villages and ASHA workers and ANMs have been asked to encourage such migrants to attend the camp,” he added. The first composite health camp would be held at Meja on Tuesday. It would be followed by camps in Phulpur, Soraon, Karchana and Handia on October 23, November 12, November 13 and November 14 respectively.

, 
, He further said that a study on migration pattern and prevalence of HIV was already underway and added “officials are also mapping high-risk groups like female sex workers, intravenous drug users and men having sex with men (MSM) so that concrete measures could be initiated to restrict the spread of the virus.”

",Coming soon: Life insurance policy for HIV/AIDS patients,"CHENNAI: , for people with AIDS and HIV may soon become a reality. The , regulator has issued draft guidelines seeking views and comments from insurers on issuing life cover policies to persons with ,.
 
, The draft circular by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (,) on policies for people with HIV/AIDS, issued this month, may come into effect from April 2014. Insurers are expected to put in place a board-approved underwriting manual, claims manual, proposal form and other necessary systems before this date.
, 
, A vast majority of those afflicted in India are in the age bracket of 15 to 49 years. As per estimates, about 2.4 million Indians are living with HIV/AIDS. Children less than 15 years account for 3.5% of it while 83% are in the age group of 15-49 years.
, 
, Health cover for people suffering from HIV/AIDS already exists. With advances in medical treatment, insurers are able to put in place cost structures. Some standalone health insurance providers like Star Health & Allied Insurance offer such insurance. ""We offer group covers to NGOs for their members. Our policy prescribes the entry parameters,"" V Jagannathan, chairman, Star Health said.
, 
, Insurers say claims management and profitability will be key concerns when life insurance is offered to those with AIDS. There would be additional costs. ""In terms of product pricing, insurers mostly rely on past claims experience. Since this would be a new product altogether, the pricing could be at both ends of the spectrum. Insurers may start at the lower range, get claims and then revise premiums upwards. They may also err on the side of caution with higher rates in the beginning and as more players come into the market, the rates would become more competitive,"" Rahul Aggarwal, CEO of Optima Insurance Brokers, said.
, 
, ""The premium loadings would also depend on the age of the person and stage of the condition,"" Vikas Gujral, executive vice-president and head, customer service and operations, Max Life Insurance said.
, 
, Some companies are looking at dual cover—health in addition to life—to ensure better claim control. ""We may insist on a health cover before issuing a life cover for this segment because in case of AIDS/HIV, the patient has lower immunity than , of the population. So, he/she is susceptible to other illnesses as well,"" a life insurer said.
, 
, Industry observers say that due to the nature of the condition, insurers would also have to contend with a huge claims outgo. ""Chances are high that the insured may use up the sum insured every year and once a policy is issued, it cannot be withdrawn,"" Aggarwal said.
, 
, Insurers are also playing it safe. Companies like Max and HDFC have already started talks with global reinsurers to participate in this scheme. ""This is a fairly complex product and we are taking inputs from reinsurers as they have global exposure on this front,"" Sanjay Tiwari, vice-president, products, , said.

I don’t see myself as a patient any more,” said 60-year-old Murugesh*, a caterer, who was diagnosed as HIV positive two decades ago. Like every other HIV infected person, the father of two thought he was as good as dead when he tested positive. “When I saw my wife and children, I re-discovered my will to live. I decided to fight against it till my last breath, and here I am two decades later,” smiled Murugesh.

We had married against our families’ wishes. We knew he would have no one if we died,” said the 42-year-old, who was infected in 2001. “My husband died in 2004. My resolve to live only grew stronger after that. I did odd jobs to fund my son’s education. Many people turned me away when they got to know I had AIDS,” said Hema, who had a near death experience in 2006. 
,

While many are waking up to the fact that HIV can’t be transmitted through sharing a glass, the awareness hasn’t gone to the extent of employing infected people. While anti-retroviral drugs has helped manage the disease, we still need to come up with a tool to help them fight stigma,” said S Noori, president of South India Positive Network. 
,
, Doctors at the hospital said the , (ART) over the last decade has helped save a lot of HIV infected people. Since its initiation at the Government General Hospital in 2005, over 7,705 patients have registered till now. ART consists of a combination of at least three antiretroviral drugs to suppress the HIV virus and stop the progression of the disease.

"Updated: Dec 1, 2013, 01:09 IST",HIV/AIDS bill still in the cans as bias goes on,"CHENNAI: A , in Bangalore was asked to stay home once he disclosed his condition to his boss in 2011. Earlier this year, the private firm forced him to resign with a monetary compensation. Adding to his woes, a legislation that promises to punish such discrimination has been in the works for several years now. 

, The HIV/AIDS Bill was drafted in 2006, but is being shunted between the health and law ministries. Activists, lawyers and people living with HIV have been fighting for the Bill to be introduced during the winter session of Parliament. Rallies are planned across the country to highlight the issue on Sunday, World AIDS Day. A senior National AIDS Control Organisation official told TOI that the Bill was now with the Cabinet. 
,
, The Bill will provide protection against discrimination in employment, education, healthcare, travel, and insurance. “It brings the private sector within its ambit. We want the Bill to be introduced in Parliament during the winter session so that it does not lapse after the general elections,” said Surekha Shetty, Legal and Advocacy Officer, Lawyers Collective. 
,
, It’s a constant struggle for those living with HIV/AIDS against social stigma. Many HIV positive children are put in schools without their condition being disclosed. “A 22- year-old girl was born with HIV as her parents were HIV positive. She completed school and college because her grandparents told the management that she had cancer,” says Dr Lakshmi Bhai, CEO, DESH, an NGO working with HIV positive people. “Hospitals refuse to perform surgeries. They would never tell us directly that we are being denied treatment because we are infected,” says D Pari, secretary, Network for Chennai people living with HIV/AIDS. 
,
, The first line and second line of treatment should free as per the , and , guidelines, but non-availability of second line drugs is a life threatening issue, say infected people. “Only four hospitals in TN provide second line drugs, and they are expensive. A few places continue to give anti-retroviral drugs with a combination of stavudine, which was banned by WHO as it has several side effects. The Bill will deal with such problems quickly,” says Daisy David, a HIV positive advocacy officer of World Vision.

, On Friday, the students will speak about HIV/AIDS on air on PU""s community radio - 91.2 MHz Jyotirgamay "" along with faculty member Gaurav Gaur and two HIV positive persons. ""The talk show on the radio is meant to bring forth those who are the real heroes for us. The stars we see on television and film screens fade in comparison to these persons who are fighting a different battle each day of their life and winning,"" said Anamika Rana, a student. 
,
, ""Also, in a way it will help get rid of the stigma associated with the disease. When students and other listeners will get to know that infected persons are open to talk about the condition, they will develop more sensitivity,"" added another student Poonam Anand. Gaur said the idea behind getting themselves voluntarily tested was to inspire others and reinforce the idea that there""s nothing ""untouchable"" about AIDS. ""It should be treated as a disease, just like any other disease,"" Anand added.

, ""The positive cases have come down drastically by more than half from 2007 numbers. If the positive cases were about 1,245 in 2007 about 90 cases being reported per month, including pregnant women, now the cases are averaging less 50 per month,"" said Dr Kishore Kumar M, District , officer. 
,
, He pointed out that while in 2007, the test to positive ration was 16% in 2013 it has come to as low as 1.45%. Delineating the statistics, he said, ""In 2007 of the 7,986 persons tested 1,245 were tested positive, in 2013 (till October end) of the 38,985 tested only 567 were positive cases. Last year, as many as 38,294 went in for testing and there were 867 cases. This year, we expect the test number to reach 44,000,"" he said. 
,
, Dr Kishore said the positive development was that every year from 2007 the cases were coming down by more than 100, hoping to achieve better progress in next couple of years. 
,
, The most heartening fact is the effective control of transmission of HIV from an HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy. Nearly five per cent of infections are attributable to parent-to-child-transmission. Dr Kishore pointed out that froma high of 82 cases in 2007 among 14,764 pregnant women tested, the numbers had come down to 23 in 2012 among 23,575 tested. This year till October 21 cases have been reported among 22,141 tested. 
,
, Among the cases reported this year till October, Mangalore taluk has the highest number at 214, followed by Bantwal (51), Belthangady (45), Puttur 927) and Sullia taluk reported 15 cases. The rest of the 215 cases are from other districts tested here. 
,
, Again male numbers are high at 364 followed by women at 203. The prevalence among persons in the age group of 15 to 49 is highest at 472 and it is 80 above age of 49. 
,
, As of now, from 2006 till date 2,492 persons are being administered ART (Anti-Retroviral Treatment). Dr Kishore said HIV management suggests that antiretroviral therapy should be recommended to those with HIV whose CD4 cell counts are below 350 cells/mm3. Earlier the threshold was 250. Antiretroviral treatment boosts the immune system and reduces the risks of HIV-related death and disease. It also lowers the risk of co-infection like tuberculosis.

"Updated: Dec 1, 2013, 13:20 IST",Sharp rise in HIV among adolescents,"LUDHIANA: Sitting in front of her counsellor, a nervous Richa rubs her hands and hesitates, as a number of questions pop up in her mind about her health. Richa is just 18 and had been diagnosed with HIV positive. And like Richa, several youngsters in their adolescence had been diagnosed with HIV in the last one and a half years.
 
, According to the data available with the , (ART) Centre in civil hospital, about 500 patients aged 15 and 24 years, under the category of adolescents, have been admitted since the last one-and-a-half years.
, 
, According to the present report, there are 3,700 patients being treated at the ART centre in Ludhiana, out of which 500 are adolescents between the age group of 15 and 24.
, 
, Two major hospitals- , and Christian Medical College and Hospital in the city also report their HIV positive cases to the ART centre.
, 
, These numbers have varied during the last four year since the ART centre was launched on December 17, 2009. Initially, the ART centre used to receive about 10-20 cases of adolescents over the years. But now the figures have increased and the centre currently treats 500 registered cases.
, 
, Talking about the tremendously increasing figures of HIV positive among the adolescents in last four years in city centre, Gurjit Singh, SMO, ART centre, said, ""At present, around 500 cases of HIV positive in adolescents are being treated here. According to data, there are two major reasons that have been found to be the reason behind the disease a?? the first being drug abuse and the second being unprotected sex or sex with more than one partner."" 
, 
, According to experts, an overview of the data reveals that out of the 3,700 HIV cases being treated, 87% are cases of sexual infection, 5-10% of drug abuse, and others due to infection from mother to child and blood transfusion. In case of adolescents, 70% cases happen due to sexual activity and rest due to drug abuse.
, 
, Vikas Garg, assistant professor medicine from Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, said, ""We receive about 10-20 HIV patients every month, of which adolescents make up for the major number of confirmed cases. The reason behind the increase in these cases is that even after widespread awareness about ,, people do not take it seriously. Drug abuse as the major reason in city had been spreading fast among the adolescents. They mainly get affected by sharing the used syringes, which many a times may be infected. And as the infected person is more prone to opportunistic infections, it leads to other diseases.""
, 
, Talking about the root cause of cases, Navjot Singh, professor and unit head department of medicine, CMC, said, ""There is only one way to cure this problem, which is by starting treatment as soon as it is diagnosed. Although, an HIV positive person is mostly left with little time, proper and timely treatment can help improve many cases.""
, 
, Besides this, some homosexual cases too had been registered, but their numbers could be said to be in negligible condition in the state and city. An overview of data from the Civil Hospital shows that when the ART centre started diagnosing HIV cases, about 720 cases were reported, while now the numbers have increased to 3,700 in the city.

, Among those who tested positive for HIV this year, men accounted for the highest number of cases (1,329) followed by women (969) cases. Three cases of HIV infection were reported among transgenders.
, 
, ""The number of new HIV infections in Pune city has fallen over the years. The steady efforts invested over a period of time to create awareness have started paying off.

There are 11 Integrated Counseling and Testing Centres (ICTC) and three ART centres in Pune
, 
, An ICTC is a place where a person is counselled and tested for HIV, of his own free will or as advised by a medical care provider. There are now more than 4,000 counselling and testing centres in India, mainly in government hospitals. In Maharashtra, there are 578 ICTCs where testing and counselling is provided free.
, 
, An ICTC conducts HIV diagnostic tests, providing basic information on the modes of HIV transmission, promoting behavioural change to reduce vulnerability, and link people with other HIV prevention, care and treatment services. Between 2011-2015, AIDS Days would focus not only on bringing new HIV infection count to zero, but also on removing discrimination and bringing down AIDS related deaths.

, ‘Getting to Zero’ implies total deletion of new infections, deaths, stigma and discrimination, and the 2015 deadline is not too far away. A recent mortality investigation carried out by semi-government entity Institute of Actuaries of India on people living with HIV (PLHIV) shows among the deceased, the illiterate population make for the higher number, unprotected sex is still the commonest reason behind the transmission of HIV, those between 25 and 49 years of age bear 83% of the death burden and there is a significant time gap between a person getting infected and him/her seeking treatment. The study investigated 1,695 deaths between April 2012 and March 2013 in 20 ART centres of five districts, representative of the whole country. 
,
, The study, carried out with support from , Aids Control Organisation (NACO), is supposed to act as a guide for insurers to design the , cover for PLHIV and price the risks accordingly. In its report, the IAI has suggested that CD4 count at the time of registering for ART, access to regular treatments and educational, economical and social backwardness were among major factors for longevity of life. It has recommended stricter data development and maintenance to ,. 
,
, The survey report underlines how the uneducated population contributes to 44% of the deaths, even though the rate of infection among them is only about 27%. Education, say experts, clearly has a defining role to play in HIV care but how and why is subject to further exploration. The report says the average time lost before a patient approaches a free anti-retroviral centre is about 7.4 months. “A delay in starting treatment could lead to faster deterioration of a patients’ health and s/he may also fall prey to opportunistic infections, like TB,” said a volunteer with one of the city’s 69 Integrated Testing and Counselling Centres. 
,
, Most worryingly, the study revealed that in 90% of the deaths, the infection was transmitted through unprotected sex. A NACO official told TOI that despite the exponential success rate of condom use, unprotected sex remained a nagging worry. In Mumbai too, it is a challenge to check the transmission of the virus among high-risk groups such as men having sex with men (MSM). “Over the last five years, MSM in Mimbai has witnessed a drop of 88% in HIV transmission. But still, the infection rate among the high-risk group in the city is much higher than the national figure,” said Dr Balkrishna Adsul, additional project director, Mumbai District Aids Control Society.

Since then, India and the world have come a long way. This year, the day was observed on the theme 'Getting to Zero,' i.e., zero new infections, zero discrimination and zero deaths.
 
, Speaking on the occasion on Sunday, renowned general physician Dr Kutikuppala Surya Rao, a specialist in the treatment of ,, gave an insight into the latest advancements in the treatment of the disease. ""In 1987, the first HIV drug Zidovidene came into market. In 2000, HIV was transformed as a chronic manageable disease. In 2010, there was a breakthrough when HIV positive , patient , turned HIV negative after stem cell therapy. Now, the focus of the world is on HIV cure. Safe sex, safe needle, safe blood, safe motherhood and respect for culture would prevent HIV/AIDS.""

, However, challenges still persist.
, 
, ""In 2012, vaccine trial on monkeys to clear HIV from blood showed promise but is yet to be tested on human. HAART (Highly active anti-retroviral therapy), can help achieve a near-normal life and zero viremia (less than 50 viral copies per ml in the blood) is possible today. But unfortunately, the HIV in the body is in the latent stage, so the HAART is not able to reach the latent virus. Unless the drug comes to attack the latent virus, the HIV problem would persist. Studies on valopuric acid (to kill the latent virus) are inconclusive.

"Updated: Dec 2, 2013, 02:56 IST",Govt hospitals pose HIV risk for doctors,"VISAKHAPATNAM: A dermatologist who runs a private , in Kakinada reveals that at least 10% of the , he treats comprise doctors and medical staff who have contracted the deadly virus while working in government hospitals. ""The number is quite alarming. But there's no way to prove that the virus has been transmitted through patients during surgeries or treatment even though the risk of contracting HIV is very high in government hospitals. Also, due to the stigma involved, the actual statistics never come out,"" the doctor informs.
 
, While private hospital doctors can choose to turn away patients who refuse to undergo HIV test prior to surgeries, there's no such option for doctors working in government hospitals. Legally, a patient can't be forced to undergo the HIV test. For operating on such patients, the medical team needs special protective and disposable gear, which may or may not be available always at state-run hospitals, exposing doctors and others in the operation theatre to the risk of contracting the deadly HIV virus. Taking elaborate safety precautions for all surgical cases is also not economically feasible, point out medical experts.
, 
, Dr P V Sudhakar, head of the department of plastic surgery and deputy superintendent of King George Hospital (KGH), informs, ""Unlike private hospitals, we can't turn away a vulnerable patient who refuses to undertake HIV test prior to a surgery. So the entire surgical team needs to be alerted about the HIV status of the patient and accordingly, the doctors, medicos and other healthcare personnel associated with the surgery need to take special precautions, wear disposable synthetic gowns and double gloves but often government hospitals run out of special gears and HIV kits. Taking universal precautions for each and every case, assuming all of them to be HIV positive or , positive cases, may not be economically feasible.""
, 
, The lack of gloves sometimes forces junior doctors or medicos to draw blood samples barehanded, a situation that clearly is alarming for them. Says a junior doctor from the hospital, ""After drawing blood samples barehanded due to the shortage of gloves, we do rush to take post-exposure prophylaxis. But this too is not recommended nor possible every time as these could be toxic drugs. There needs to be continuous supply of special gears and kits for dealing with HIV patients. The only other option for us is to purchase the disposable gloves from our pocket each time we assist in surgeries or draw blood.""
, 
, When queried, Dr Jayachandra Reddy, joint director, basic services, , (APSACS) remarked, ""Indiscriminate HIV testing is not required prior to surgery for all patients. Naco (,) has already prescribed testing for all pregnant women. Besides, high risk vulnerable groups and TB symptomatic patients should be tested for HIV before operations. Instead, doctors should rather opt for universal safety precautions while undertaking every surgery to curtail the risk of transmission.""

Accordingly, a new drug regimen which will have three instead of one drug is being adopted in Maharashtra and some other states from this World AIDS Day. For those children who have acquired the infection, efforts are being made to improve their quality of life, and thus chances of longevity.

, ""Since the new regimen will come into practice soon, we wanted our members to know about the changes in treatment modalities,"" said IMA, Nagpur president Dr Warsha Dhawale. Explaining the new regimen and the reason for introducing it, Dr Kedar who is also the chairperson of IMA's HIV committee said, ""For preventing the transmission of virus from mother to child, we give the mother only one drug. Resistance has developed against this drug in the virus, so we will start administering three drugs to pregnant positive women.""
, 
, Primary prevention measure must be to avoid unwanted pregnancy and monitor a planned one in an HIV positive woman, said Dr Kulkarni. ""Once infected, it is important to link them to proper care and treatment. The new programme seems much more efficient than the previous one. Its success, however, would depend on the extent of patients covered. The most important thing is to screen all pregnant women for HIV and link all patients to proper facilities,"" he said.
, 
, Along with this, stress must be given on adolescent counselling to prevent new cases of the disease as India is among the top 12 countries as far as load of HIV-positive adolescents are concerned, said Dr Kedar. Agreed Dr Bhurshundi and added, ""Though the prevalence of HIV is decreasing, there is another alarming trend to be concerned about. Most people affected by the disease are in the 18-24 age group and yet there is not much research or stress on these patients.""
, 
, He also warned that affected people should lay clear off quacks who claim that they can be rid of the virus. ""Instead of being stringent about one's drug schedule and following doctors' instructions can improve one's quality of life tremendously,"" said Dr Bhurshundi.

, The vows that Jyoti Dhawale and Vivek Surve exchanged on October 13 this year, with the blessings of lord Ram, Sita, Jagannath, Balram and Subhadra, weren’t just the usual that Hindu , do.
, 
, Surve, art director at a leading publishing house, pledged to support Dhawale, 38, in her fight to lift the stigma off AIDS, and gradually tweak the mindset of those around them by being a model ‘mixed status’ couple.
, 
, And that’s not the only stereotype they are crashing.
, 
, Dhawale is no emaciated, drawn HIV victim. She fills up the room when she hurries in. “I can’t hear,” she says, motioning to her hearing aid. Her eardrums were damaged in a car accident when she was three.
, 
, But her hardest struggle has been to fight the stigma that came with the HIV virus she contracted eight years ago due to medical negligence.
, 
, The three abortions she underwent between 2004 and 2006 (“Oral contraceptive made me nauseous and my ex-husband didn’t care for condoms”) did her in. The homemaker, blogger and HIV activist believes infected surgical implements may have been used. “Poz? Me? Not possible. There has to be a mistake,” she writes on her blog, recounting receiving the test results when she went in for her fourth abortion. That she had destroyed records of all three previous surgeries meant she couldn’t hold anyone accountable. “The nursing home staff suggested I have the baby because it was my last chance due to the complications the serial abortions had led to.”
, 
, Until then, Dhawale admits, she knew nothing about the Human Immunodeficiency Virus which triggers the progressive failure of the immune system, allowing life-threatening infections to thrive. “I thought it only happened to those with multiple partners. I didn’t have them, neither did my husband.” The Vasai , she delivered her baby at (he is seven years old now), administered Zidovudine, an antiretroviral drug, to prevent transmission of virus from mother to child. Her marriage ended in 2007 — “due to incompatibility, not the infection”, she clarifies — making her isolation complete. The counselling centre run by Kripa Foundation that she was directed to was ill equipped to empower patients with accurate information about medicine dosage, side effects or the nature of the virus.
, 
, She realised she had to know more. The online information space was one she chose to dip into between 2010 and 2011, sparking off her transformation. Dhawale learnt that virus transmission didn’t stand a chance if partners stayed healthy and the infected person kept the virus count low with medication.
, 
, “In India, abstinence is the only solution experts offer,” she says, recounting how an ‘AIDS specialist’ she visited in 2012 advised Surve, who was then her boyfriend, against kissing her. “He even suggested we wear gloves while being intimate. Even if traces of the virus exist in the ,, it cannot be transmitted unless one or both partners have bleeding gums or open sores. It’s the same during oral sex unless one partner suffers from an STD or the viral load is at a detectable level,” she clarifies.
, 
, In fact, it was during her time online that she met Surve. The two hit it off, and eventually she told him she was HIV+ve. “He disappeared for three months,” she giggles.
, 
, “I was shocked,” he says. “But not a single day went by when I did not think of her.”
, 
, Surve, who Dhawale says on her blog, had dilly dallied for two-anda-half years, offered a commitment this August when she was ironically preparing to participate at an HIV matrimonial meet in Pune. Expectedly, there was resistance from Surve’s family. After all, she had a ‘sex worker’s’ disease. “We tell people on a need-to-know basis, and educate them on how it’s transmitted,” says Surve, who admits that it’s family and close friends who are aware that they are a serodiscordent couple.
, 
, That Dhawale never let the virus , her vivacity has made sure the couple enjoy a “rocking, fearless but protected sex life”. “There are procedures to follow in case of a , tear, pills you can take within 72 hours of the act, under the doctor’s guidance,” explains Surve.
, 
, Their constant effort is to keep the virus load down, reducing any chance of transmission. The medicines that Dhawale takes twice a day at times so precise, the couple set an alarm for it, are personalised based on her lifestyle, and blood, liver parameters. “If you miss a dose, the virus will multiply. If you overdose, the hormones go for a toss,” he says.
, 
, Does the fear of untimely death hang over the couple? “With proper exercise, diet and medication,” he says, “an HIV+ve person can outlive an HIV-ve one. We are making sure Jyoti does.”
, 
, 
,
, Always use a condom. Have your partner tested for HIV before engaging in a physical relationship and/or marriage. Insist that labs, , and , use disposable syringes and screens.

Addressing a meeting on the eve of , on Saturday, state epidemiologist of ASACS Chiranjeev Bhattacharjee said, ""In Assam, a rising trend in HIV prevalence, especially among pregnant women, has been observed but it is still lower when compared to other groups. The evidence suggests that the HIV epidemic in the state is mainly driven by bridge populations such as migrants and the truckers."" He said the absence of sentinel sites to monitor HIV prevalence among truckers and migrants is responsible for the limited data on their role in the spread of HIV from high risk groups to the general populace.

Figures released by the , (MDACS) on the eve of , show that 36,920 HIV patients in the city have been put on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) over the years.
 
, The therapy has been instrumental in changing the perception of AIDS from being a death sentence to a manageable chronic disease. ""This is a 96.2% increase in the number of patients taking ART since 2008,"" said Dr B Adsul, additional project director at MDACS. The numbers show that the AIDS-control programme is spreading wider into the community.

, ""In the last five years, we have managed to increase the number of patients coming to us for treatment by 60%,'' added Dr Adsul. That HIV-positive individuals are living healthier lives can be gauged from the fact almost 40% of the registered patients don't need ART yet, said a MDACS official. This means their blood counts aren't yet plunging to levels that need ART,'' they said.

A , says that AIDS-related deaths amongst adolescents between the ages of 10 and 19 increased by 50% between 2005 and 2012, rising from 71,000 to 110,000 and that many adolescents were unaware that they were infected. 

, The 2013 Stocktaking Report on Children and AIDS—released on the occasion of World AIDS on Sunday-- says that an estimated 74% of the 2.1 million adolescents live in 12 high burden countries. It says that investments to the tune of USD 5.5 billion by next year will be required to avoid an added two million adolescents, particularly girls, becoming infected by 2020. Investments in 2010 were US$3.8 billion. 
,
, “If high-impact interventions are scaled up using an integrated approach, we can halve the number of new infections among adolescents by 2020,” said , Executive Director Anthony Lake. “It’s a matter of reaching the most vulnerable adolescents with effective programmes – urgently.” 
,
, The report also found that girls are more vulnerable among adolescents. Of the total of 2.1 million individuals, 1.2 million are females. The total infected adolescent population in South Asia is 130,000 with 51% men and 49% women. Much more attention is needed to prevent and treat HIV during adolescence, so that children remain AIDS-free in the second decade of life. New infections among adolescents could be halved by 2020 by scaling up high-impact interventions and working across sectors. The treatment, care and support needs of children living with HIV change as they grow older and begin to take greater responsibility for their own health. But services generally do not keep pace with or cater to their needs. This is particularly true for marginalized adolescents males who have sex with males, adolescents who inject drugs and sexually exploited adolescents despite the disproportionately high prevalence of HIV among them. 
,
, Experts have advised a combination of high-impact interventions including condoms, antiretroviral treatment, prevention of mother-to-child transmission, voluntary medical male circumcision, communications for behaviour change, and targeted approaches for at-risk and marginalized populations. This is in addition to investments in other sectors such as education, social protection and welfare, and strengthening health systems.

, In fact, when Vimal spoke about his marriage with a physician, he was told to avoid tying the knot. The doctor advised lying about his HIV status would be unethical and unjust to the girl. He was surprised to know that Nidhi, who knew Vimal for three years, was aware of his disease but determined to marry the Ahmedabad-based sales executive. 
,
, “I refused to believe my patient and asked him to bring his girlfriend along for counseling. I thought the girl was probably blinded by love and did not know the seriousness of the disease,’’ said infectious diseases specialist Dr Atul Patel. “I was surprised to meet the girl who was aware of the challenges of living with an HIV infected person. In fact, she was adamant that she would not let HIV be an obstacle to her love.’’ 
,
, The marriage is a personal victory of love. But it reflects changing attitudes related to , as well. Experts say a decade ago, they would have to grapple with not only the physical and mental fallouts of the dreaded infection but also emotional manifestations of the being abandoned out of fear. At least two of every 10 patients would be divorced and many disowned by their families. 
,
, “The current social scenario for HIV patients is far more positive. Not only do we see a lot of HIV positive patients marrying each other, we are also seeing boys and girls with no infection willingly marrying HIV positive people. This trend signifies a greater acceptance of HIV in society and the fact that HIV is not a death sentence. It is a disease which can be managed with good treatment and care,” said Dr Patel.

According to the officials, around 250 HIV positive deliveries take place in Vizag district every year.
 
, As per the PPCT treatment, HIV testing is conducted on all pregnant women and if found positive, anti-retroviral treatment (ART) is administered from the 14th week of pregnancy, irrespective of the CD4 count. Right after birth, Nevirapine and Septran syrup are given to the baby. Blood tests (DBS-PCR tests) are also done from time to time till the child is one-and-half-years old. If the child tests HIV negative, then he or she can be said to be free from HIV transmission. Breastfeeding is also encouraged since the mother is kept on ART drugs.
, 
, Additional district medical and health officer (AIDS and leprosy) Dr Ronanki Ramesh said, ""Currently, around 8,000 HIV positive pregnant women are undergoing ART in Vizag as per the government records. We are focusing on zero vertical transmission of the virus from the mother to the newborn and therefore implementing PPCT in every possible antenatal case. This advanced drug regime was introduced on September 2012 as a pilot project in AP and Karnataka and now the success rate is almost 98%. We will soon conduct sensitization workshops for private gynaecologists so that PPCT is followed in every case.""

, Besides a decrease in vertical transmission in antenatal cases, focus is given on bringing down HIV-TB co-infections. ""Since HIV patients develop tuberculosis as an opportunistic infection, we are focusing on such patients too so that incidence of HIV-TB can be brought down.

, 
, ""Of the 15,228 jail inmates who volunteered to get themselves tested for HIV this year, 116 tested positive. Forty five have been put on antiretroviral treatment because of low CD4 count,"" an MSACS official said. The CD4 cells are specialised cells that protect the body. The virus attacks these cells and uses them to spread, which weakens the immune system.
, 
, Officials of MSACS said that jail inmates are regularly informed about the causes of spread of HIV and counselled to reduce risks. ""We have trained counsellors who help spread awareness about HIV infection among prisoners and encourage them to get themselves tested.

Likewise, 1,818 new persons were put on anti-retroviral therapy in 2012 and till January 2013 at IMS ,, Varanasi. Not in keeping with this falling trend, however, 3,162 new cases were reported in 2010 for ART at IMS BHU. But, other government centres of the state witnessed a significant fall in new cases of HIV infection.
, 
, Not only UP, the similar trend has also been witnessed in the country. The recently released UNAIDS Report 2013 stated that India has managed to reduce new HIV infections by 57% between 2001 and 2012.
, 
, Health experts attributed increased public awareness as one of the main reasons behind the fall in number of new HIV cases being reported. ""Due to various educational programmes, people have become more aware about HIV/AIDS. More and more patients in both government and private hospitals insist on use of new needle for injection,"" said A K Tripathi, head of department of clinical haematology.
, 
, The other reason is improvement in blood bank services as blood is now checked thoroughly before transfusion. ""The ban on sale of blood has helped a lot,"" said Dr Tripathi. Another major cause is the widespread availability of ART which suppressed the HIV virus and stops the progression of HIV disease. Earlier, ART was available at only a few hospitals of the state but now UP has 22 centres and many district hospitals are linked to centres where HIV persons can get the medicines.
, 
, ""Due to ART, the situation has now become better than earlier. There has been decline in rate of new HIV infections and it will reduce more in the coming days,"" said Preetam Kaur, president of Lucknow Positive Women Welfare Society.

, There are over 60 different epidemic strains of HIV and geographic regions are often dominated by one or two of these. It has been confirmed earlier that if a person becomes infected with two different strains, they can fuse and a recombined form can occur.

,
, The period from infection to development of AIDS was the shortest reported among HIV-1 types, at around five years.

, “Recombinants seem to be more vigorous and more aggressive than the strains from which they developed. The recombinant studied is called A3/02 and is a cross between the two most common strains in Guinea-Bissau, 02AG and A3,” said Angelica Palm from Lund University. 
,
, So far the new strain has only been identified in West Africa, but other studies have shown that the global , of different recombinants is increasing. 
,
, “In countries and regions with high levels of immigration, such as the US and Europe, the trend is towards an increasingly mixed and complex HIV flora, unlike in the beginning of the epidemic when a small number of non-recombinant variants of the virus dominated. There is, therefore, reason to be wary of HIV recombinants in general,” Palm added. 
,
, The virus strain was first reported by Joakim Esbjornsson from the University of Oxford, who is the co-author of the study.

,
, “HIV is an extremely dynamic and variable virus. New subtypes and recombinant forms of HIV-1 have been introduced to our part of the world, and it is highly likely that there are a large number of circulating recombinants of which we know little or nothing.

, Though the study was done in the city, the findings more or less hold good for Indian patients in all cities, Dr Surya Rao said. The study was necessitated as several ethical issues and challenges started emerging, especially in terms of the standard of care of HIV/AIDS patients, due to the increasing commercialisation of the medical profession, the doctor stated.
, 
, The study sought the opinion of the patients on parameters and ethical issues such as principles of autonomy, paternalism or dictatorship, dignity of individual, informed consent, right to refuse treatment, principles of confidentiality, patient's right to know about his treatment and also role of surrogates (family or relatives).
, 
, Of the 1,800 HIV positive patients, 1,450 fully participated in the study between March 2011 and February 2013 and are under treatment at ,, Visakhapatnam. After getting complete responses from 1,450 patients, the study found that 65.6% of the patients faced paternalism or authoritarian behaviour from doctors, 55.2% felt they were not treated in a dignified manner, 75.8% patients faced lack of autonomy, informed consent (that is explaining the pros and cons of treatment and contraindications to patients) was not taken from 55.1% patients, 87.2% patients had no choice to refuse treatment, principle of confidentiality about treatment and HIV status was maintained only in 48.2% cases. Further, just 24.1% of patients said they were informed about their treatment procedures and in 86.2% cases, it's the patients' relatives or guardians who spoke to the doctor on behalf of the patients without giving the patients a chance to speak up about their problems.
, 
, ""Overall, it was felt that the , Organisation and , should formulate and implement new ethical guidelines in the treatment and care of HIV/AIDS patients in the background of severe stigma attached to HIV/AIDS,"" stated Dr Rao.
, 
, Referring to the key points of the study, professor of psychiatry and superintendent of Government Hospital for ,, Vizag, Dr N N Raju, pointed out that HIV-AIDS is one ailment that is associated with a lot of stigma and different socio-psychological aspects are involved, especially in India. ""Many a time, we come across family members who request the treating doctors not to reveal the HIV status to the patient as they fear the patient would get depressed or turn suicidal if they learn the truth. In such cases, getting informed consent becomes difficult.""
, 
, ""Moreover, in India, the doctor-patient ratio is disproportionate and one doctor sometimes has to see around 100 patients a day, which makes giving a patient hearing to each case difficult. More social workers and trained counsellors are required to generate awareness. With effective treatment regime available, HIV, like TB, can be controlled to a great extent and so the stigma needs to be dispelled gradually as has happened in the case of TB in last few decades,"" stated the doctor.

, 
, Although the method of transmission for both the viruses is same, medicines to treat HIV-1 patients do not work for HIV-2 patients. This explains the fact that there are currently no medicines that the government is prescribing for HIV-2 patients.

In 2013, 38 babies born to HIV positive mothers tested negative in Trichy.
 
, Since the beginning of this year, 'Nevirapine' tablets were administered to HIV-positive mothers 76 hours before delivery while babies were administered Nevirapine syrup from the time of their birth at all ART centres. Though that type of treatment was useful to bring down the number of births of HIV-positive babies, the , (TANSACS) that decided to eradicate it completely, made a change in the treatment method. As per the new method, the Nevirapine tablets should be taken by HIV-positive mothers for 14 weeks during pregnancy and the babies should be given Nevirapine syrup for at least six months.
, 
, Dr Manivannan, , of the ART centre in Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH), Trichy said that the new regimen of treatment was proved to be effective to ensure the birth of HIV-negative babies born to HIV-positive mothers. ""We work towards achieving the target of nil birth of HIV-positive babies in 2015. We hope it will be possible to reach the target with the present mode of treatment to the HIV-positive mothers. With this method, we can bring down the rate of possibility of babies getting affected to one to two percent from the previous rate of 20 per cent,"" he said.
, 
, In 2012, 45 babies were born to HIV-positive mothers. However, only one baby tested positive and the rest of them tested negative.
, 
, It is unfortunate that in most of the cases the HIV-positive mothers are victims of marriage with HIV-positive men. At the time of marriage, women are not made aware whether their partners are HIV-positive. On the other hand, the men are also lethargic to go for HIV test before marriage. ""When it is found during pregnancy check-up that a woman is HIV-positive, it comes as a shock to them. But many of the uneducated people from rural areas are not bothered about it. At the same time, the educated people from urban areas completely collapse. So, we have to provide counselling to them to give morale booster,"" said Dr Manivannan who appealed to all the married women to undergo HIV test.
, 
, The blood of the new born baby is tested through dry blood sample (DBC) method at the , in Chennai. Normally, the presence of HIV virus can be confirmed only after 18 months of delivery. However, Dr Manivannan said that the results through DBC method would almost be the same as the results that come after 18 months.

, The health ministry’s data shows that outreach programmes have helped bring down HIV prevalence in high-risk communities like transgender (TG), , (MSM) among others. HIV prevalence for transgender has come down from 42.21% in 2006 to 8.82% in 2011, while for MSMs the figure has declined from 8.74% to 4.43%. 
,
, Targeted intervention for high-risk communities are priority of the Rs 8632.77 crore National , Control Programme Phase-IV approved by the cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) in October. 
,
, The stated objective of NACP-IV is to reduce new infections by 50% and intensify and consolidate prevention services with a focus on high-risk groups and vulnerable population and the general population. 
,
, According to NGO, Humsafar Trust, which is active in outreach programmes for the LGBT community, about 7.5 lakh people are being reached through the health ministry initiative. “The government’s programme has brought down HIV prevalence by 57% in high risk groups. But now we have gone 20 years behind. Our outreach workers had the blanket of the High Court order when they went out for awareness generation and interventions. Now, they will be harassed,’’ Vivek Anand from Mumbai based , said.

,
, According to a World Bank report while India is increasing the coverage of targeted interventions for the most at risk populations, it will be critical to sustain these efforts and expand more rapidly in those areas and among those population groups, which are lagging behind and hard to reach; most importantly, comprehensive harm reduction programmes among injecting drug users, and safe sex among men having sex with men.

They were jailed for 47 days, their HIV/AIDS- related material seized and the offices of their NGOs Naz Foundation and Bharosa Trust sealed. 

, Health workers in Chennai, Bangalore and Delhi endured similar harassment, noted , in its publication ""Epidemic of Abuse-Police Harassment of HIV/AIDS outreach workers"". The document highlights a bitter reality of India’s battle against HIV/AIDS—fighting the disease becomes an uphill task when criminality is attached to vulnerable communities. 
,
, Much of these challenges associated with fighting HIV/AIDS were overcome thanks to the Delhi High Court judgement decriminalising same-sex relations in 2009. But they have been resurrected with the Supreme Court’s judgement on Wednesday. Activists fear the judgment will pose a huge setback for HIV/AIDS. 
,
, ""It will have a devastating impact on the fight against HIV/AIDS. In the early days it was very hard to get MSMs to health units as they feared police action. This changed only after the Delhi HC judgement,"" says Dr. L Ramakrishnan of Solidarity and Action Against the , Infection in India. He pointed out that the apex court’s judgement was likely to give legal backing to the biases of healthcare professionals and could fuel their discriminatory attitudes. 
,
, The issue is particularly pressing as MSMs are a high-risk category for HIV/AIDS. Roughly seven per cent of the estimated 25 lakh gay persons in India are HIV-infected, according to the Central government. Their marginalisation in healthcare was in fact the basis of the Public Interest Litigation filed by the Naz Foundation in the Delhi HC. 
,
, The National , Control Organization too had admitted in its affidavit that Section 377 acted as a ""serious impediment"" to successful public health interventions. ""Those in the high risk group are mostly reluctant to reveal same-sex behaviour due to fear of law enforcement agencies, keeping a large section invisible and unreachable and thereby pushing the cases of infection underground making it very difficult for public health workers to even access them,"" stated the , affidavit. It had pointed out that social stigma forced many MSMs to deny their behaviour, thereby marrying or having sex with female partners and subsequently putting them too at the risk of HIV/AIDS. 
,

Will this mean that the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) would require dropping this huge and vulnerable population group out of their future plans?

, ""For decades, we have worked towards bringing out the hidden population of LGBTQ community to speak about their sexual problems in order to bring down the number of HIV cases amongst them. Now, even if we were to go somewhere to create awareness or discuss a project, it would be likened to encouraging an illegal activity,"" said Kunal Maind, programme manager of NGO Saarthi Trust. This will result in an increase in HIV cases as gay people would fear to come out, which ultimately will be the society's loss, he added.
, 
, Questioning the intent and legality of the services and counselling provided to the community by these NGOs is a major worry among them. ""Our field workers are scared that if they go out for any awareness activity, the society will not accept them. Most importantly, they fear for their safety as police or anti-social elements can exploit this situation,"" said Amitgiri Goswami, project manager of GAURAV TI project. In the absence of follow-up of this very vulnerable group of population and awareness among them, there would be an increase in the risk factors, thus taking up the number of people affected by the infection, he feared.

With the staff of Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS) on strike, the 40-year-old didn't know where to go. It's a similar scene across ART Centres in the state for almost a week now.

I could not save my son,"" said the 37-year-old mother of two. She does not cry or show any emotions as she narrates her son's painful journey since he was diagnosed with tuberculosis in December 2012. The robust Revised National TB Control Programme was of no consequence to the lower-middle- class family that spent over Rs 4 lakh, collected by selling land and other assets, to fund his treatment in a private hospital.
, 
, The teenager, by his mother's own admission, faltered on the tuberculosis treatment and developed resistance to the drugs. This January, when his condition deteriorated, the family admitted him to Sewri TB Hospital, where MDR-TB was diagnosed. ""He often complained about the medication and injections,"" said the mother. ""I had no idea about MDR-TB. Doctors don't tell you much. They should have told me the drugs can make one suicidal,"" the mother said.

He developed breathing problems around 2am and called his mother on her cell phone. She rushed to his ward immediately. ""The nurse saw me there and started screaming. She said if someone misbehaved with me in a male ward, the hospital will not be responsible. I was asked to leave immediately,"" she said, adding the scuffle happened in front of her son.

They demanded that the department of AIDS control (DAC) increase VLT availability. The test is crucial to detecting the onset of AIDS.
 
, Networks affiliated to People Living with HIV (PLHIV) like the Manipur-based Community Network for Empowerment (Cone), a state-level network of people who use drugs, and Medicine Sans Frontiers (MSF) stated that the Manipur State AIDS Clinical Expert Panel (SACEP) is not doing enough to ensure availability of VLT. It also accused SACEP of falling prey to bureaucratic red tape and putting the lives of HIV positive people at risk.

, ""In Assam and Sikkim, samples are sent directly to the referral laboratory in Kolkata. However, HIV positive people in Nagaland, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh have to come to the , in Imphal to give their blood samples.

, Till July 2013, Mizoram had 8,258 HIV positive people, with 2,556 patients on ART, 12 patients on second line treatment, and 14 people waiting for VLT. Two people died last year in December while waiting for VLT. In Manipur, there are more than 40,000 HIV positive people. VLT determines the success of ART. There are VLT machines in Manipur, Assam and Megahalya but they are not recognized by NACO.

This would include treatment for opportunistic infections and related illnesses like hepatitis C. The NGOs also demanded that basic amenities such as drinking water, sanitation and seating arrangements at all ART centres should be provided to PLHIVs.

,
, He also pointed out that with advances in anti-retroviral therapy (ART) death due to HIV infections has been on the wane. However, most of the deaths that still occur are due to secondary or co-infections with liver diseases due to hepatitis virus co-infection being the most common cause.

, Often referred to as a viral time bomb, the disease is widespread among intravenous drug users (IDUs). Manipur's Surachanpur and Bishnupur districts have the highest number of people carrying the , (HCV), with prevalence rates among the districts' IDUs being nearly 90 per cent and 78 per cent respectively.
, 
, In Nagaland's Wokha and Phek districts, the prevalence rate, as per an Integrated Bio Behavioural Assessment Round 2 Testing, conducted in 2009 by the , and others, was 20.8 per cent and 8.7 per cent respectively. Prior studies showed that in Manipur, the prevalence rate of HCV is 55 to 80 per cent among IDUs, as opposed to 22 to 33 per cent HIV prevalence among them.
, 
, ""The main objective is to create awareness about viral Hepatitis in the region. The epidemic is at our doorstep, with people getting infected, testing positive and some deaths being reported. However, NGOs and the government continue to ignore the spread of the disease,"" said Ketho, general secretary of , (HEPCON).
, 
, With much of the focus being restricted to HIV-AIDS and cancer awareness, HCV often escapes attention. With no proper cure or vaccine, course-related HCV treatment is also considered too expensive. People with HCV are prone to develop chronicity that can lead to liver damages. Research show that close to 75 to 85 per cent HCV patients develop chronicity, as opposed to Hepatitis-B patients (HBV).
, 
, ""Intravenous drug users are the most vulnerable. HCV prevalence is much higher than that of HIV. This indicates that there is a bigger pool of HCV patients among IDUs,"" said Gajendra Kumar Medhi, doctor and scientist with the Indian Council of Medical Research.
, 
, Another factor responsible for the high prevalence of HCV amongst IDUs is needle-sharing. Even with efforts to promote safe injecting practices, the prevalence of needle-sharing is quite high. Users may lessen sharing of syringes, but indirect sharing is widely practiced. Nearly 50 to 70 per cent IDUs admitted to sharing accessories like common containers for drug preparation, filter cotton and rinse water.

, ""Sugarcane cutters move from field to field over November to April every year.

, 
, ""Sugarcane cutters are paid at one time; generally before the beginning of the cutting season. They carry cash with them and use it to pay sex workers. Often, sexual intercourse is unprotected; hence they are prone to HIV infection. Some of these workers are also engage in casual sex with female co-workers in their groups or a group travelling together from one field to another. In interior rural areas, no contraceptives are available. In such situations, the possibility of transmission of infection increases,"" said MSACS regional programme officer Jagdish Patil. Many sugarcane cutters have also been detected for HIV-tuberculosis co-infection, he said.
, 
, Asked about the CEO's proposal, Patil said, ""If it works, it will be a major achievement in this field because the migrants are major carriers of HIV infection in all sectors and it is tough to maintain a follow-up on them.

An erratic drug supply of second-line medication has forced thousands of patients—some from as far as Nagpur, Sindhudurg, Akola and even parts of Gujarat—to frequent the treatment centre multiple times a week to collect the drugs instead of the usual once-a-month practice. 

, “Most HIV-positive people hide their status at their workplace. We cannot afford to seek leave every alternate day to collect the medicines. Several people have lost their jobs because of this,” said an , patient, adding that lately he has been asking for leave once every week. The Bhayander resident said he has already switched jobs twice as too many questions about his absenteeism were raised at the workplace.

, Another HIV-positive patient, a 37-year-old Sion resident, said he has been missing doses as his boss has started questioning his medical fitness. “How many leaves can an office grant in a week? We cannot even buy the drugs from outside given the steep cost,” he complained. 
,
, Patients are livid that while other four ART centres—in Nagpur, Aurangabad, Pune and Sangli—have dealt with the medicine shortage by procuring them locally, the same zeal was lacking at JJ, which has been accused of inadequate supply of drugs for the last six months. The only centre to disburse second-line medicines in city, it also caters to patients from Konkan region.

The woman “likely” acquired the virus during a six-month monogamous relationship with a 43-yearold HIV-positive woman in Texas, the , and Prevention (CDC) reported. 

, In August 2012, the Houston department of health contacted CDC regarding the rare transmission of HIV likely by sexual contact between two women. Laboratory testing confirmed that the woman with newly diagnosed HIV infection had avirus virtually identical to that of her female partner, who was diagnosed previously with HIV and who had stopped receiving antiretroviral treatment in 2010. 
,
, The woman with newly acquired infection did not report any other recognized risk factors for HIV infection, and the viruses infecting the two women had 98% sequence identity in three genes. 
,
, Transmission of HIV between women who have , (WSW) has been reported rarely and is difficult to ascertain. 
,
, The potential for , by female-to-female sexual contact includes unprotected exposure to vaginal or other body fluids and to blood from menstruation , or to exposure to blood from trauma during rough sex. 
,
, Other potential exposures associated with HIV transmission in WSW that must be ruled out include injection drug use (IDU), heterosexual sex, tattooing, acupuncture , piercing, use of shared sex toys between the partners and other persons, exposure to body fluids of others, and receipt of transplants or transfusion, the report said. The woman who acquired HIV had a history of heterosexual intercourse, but not in the 10 years before HIV infection. 
,
, She reported three female sexual partners in the preceding 5 years but said she had no IDU, receipt of tattoos, acupuncture, transfusions, transplants, or any other recognised HIV risk behaviour . The woman supplemented her income by selling her plasma and had tested negative for HIV by HIV-1 /2 enzyme immunoassay (EIA) serology screening after donating plasma in March 2012.

They admitted that the boy had tested negative for the virus before his , in December, but tested positive for it in March.
 
, The hospital claims they have clear records of the three people, whose blood was transfused into the boy, and tests to show that they were HIV negative. ""We do not know how the virus entered the boy's blood stream,"" admitted the hospital's chairman K G Bhakthavatchalam.
, 
, ""December could have been a window period for the virus, so it did not show in the blood tests done in December,"" he added. Insisting that his hospital was not responsible for transfusing HIV positive blood into the boy, he claimed that it could've happened ""during any usual treatment administered during the boy's childhood"".
, 
, The boy had been treated by the hospital for more than three months for kidney failure. Both his kidneys had failed; he was undergoing dialysis and needed a transplant urgently.
, 
, Doctors admit that the ""window period theory"" could have happened, but say a detailed viral load test is required to confirm the virus and monitor the infection. Doctors say if the boy is infected with HIV type 1, there are incidents of the virus strain not showing up in blood tests for months or even years after it enters a person's blood stream. ""It may have entered due to a mistake that happened much earlier,"" said a doctor.
, 
, ""The viral load test will also give us an idea of the danger it poses immediately, how it should be treated and how long the virus may have been present in the boy,"" says Dr Soundaravel, assistant resident medical officer of , and Hospital (CMCH) indicating that it could hold clues to the above controversy. The viral load test would also indicate whether he needs antiretroviral therapy. ""His CD 4 cell count should be checked regularly to monitor his body's immune system, especially since he is undergoing dialysis treatment and will be on immunosuppressant drugs,"" he added. ""He will have to undergo dialysis for the rest of his life, and if his CD4 count falls he should be very careful with infections,"" he further added.
, 
, Doctors also admitted there were possibilities of the hospital not following protocols laid down by the ,. ""We are made to take a detailed case history on every pint of blood we collect and store. We have records of illnesses, diseases and alcohol history of the donor and strains of it present in the blood. We also test each of them for HIV, hepatitis B and C, syphilis and malarial bacteria before making it ready for issue,"" said Dr Shyam of ,, which with 150 to 200 units of blood has one of the largest blood banks in the city.

"Updated: Mar 16, 2014, 01:31 IST",Most hospitals refuse to treat HIV patients," COIMBATORE: A day after a private hospital in Race Course in the city refused to treat a 16-year-old boy further because he was , positive, NGOs working with HIV positive patients said almost 98% of private institutions in the city reject patients if they are HIV infected.
, 
, Kamakshi (name changed), 43, a house-wife who was HIV positive had to undergo a simple colonoscopy because her physician advised her to do so after she complained of chronic stomach pain. She approached a mid-level hospital in Sundarapuram and got her admission form done. However, when she told the staff that she was HIV positive, they returned her admission and claimed they had too many patients lined up for colonoscopy for the next two days and didn't have a vacant bed even in the general ward. ""They asked me to a call three days later or better approach a government hospital for the test,"" she said.
, 
, The Coimbatore Positive Network, a city-based NGO, said the polite rejection that Kamakshi received was better than usual. ""Almost all private hospitals in the city and surrounding districts refuse to treat or operate on HIV patients,"" said the network's president M Somesh. ""They tell patients that they don't have facilities or infrastructure to treat HIV positive people,"" he said. They tell them to go to government hospitals in Coimbatore or Pollachi, he added.
, 
, A campaign by the network sensitization programmes held by , (TANSACS), three large hospitals have agreed to treat and operate HIV patients. ""We have got them to conduct around 15 deliveries so far,"" says Somesh. However, these hospitals charge HIV patients twice the amount they take from regular patients. ""They claim they have to purchase disposable instruments and gear such as gloves, masks, costumes which they have to dispose after one use and hence the higher charge,"" said Somesh. But we are glad that they at least treat us, so we have learned to bear the costs, he said.
, 
, Though Coimbatore district has more than 10,300 registered HIV positive patients, the two government hospitals and one link centre are the only venues where a patient can get Anti retroviral therapy (ART) at subsidised rate. ""Even if other private hospitals offer ART, they do not tell us. In fact, hospitals that treat HIV positive patients do not want it to be known,"" said Somesh.
, 
, Hospitals said they can't be blamed, because ART medication is expensive and the general public is scared of being treated along-side HIV positive patients. ""We have a separate wing to treat HIV patients, conduct surgeries and even do deliveries. We do not publicise it much because we do not want our general patients to live in fear of a transfusion mistake or infection,"" said a doctor at one of the hospitals that treat HIV patients. ""We do not want doctors to lose out on their normal patients,"" he added.
, 
, Surprisingly, not a single complaint has been filed against any hospital for rejecting a HIV positive patient. ""We have not got any such complaints against a hospital so far,"" said Dr A S Valan, regional coordinator, TANSACS. ""When we get such a complaint we will refer it to the , and sensitise the particular hospital,"" he says. The law clearly mentions that HIV patients can't be discriminated against.
, 
, IMA officials said many hospitals refuse HIV patients not because they intend to discriminate but simply because ""they lack the expertise to treat them"". ""Treatment of HIV patients is becoming a specialty on its own. For example, you need to understand the stage of the virus and there are drugs which can't be prescribed along with ART drugs,"" said IMA state president Dr M Balasubramanian.
, 
, This is a far cry from Chennai where almost all big hospitals have started treating HIV patients. ""We haven't got any complaints from our members about being turned away from a hospital, despite them being very poor,"" says S Noori, president, South India Positive Network.

, 
, Having tested positive for HIV-contracted from different partners-some years ago, the 43-year-old Desmond and 38-year-old Catherine did not let AIDS tie their lives in knots. Instead, they tied the knot, and thanks to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) their child is HIV negative.
, 
, For Melvin and Janet D'Souza, both also ,, the tying of the knot happened 30 years ago. They chose not to have children.
, 
, NGOs working towards enlightening society on the humane treatment of those with HIV say more and more people with AIDS in Goa are taking the plunge into marriage.
, 
, ""Loneliness and lack of companionship often lead to neglect of one's health, so having a partner does create an environment for a better future and longer life,"" says Maria Cardoso, project officer at Udant.
, 
, Anita Pereira, also with the NGO, says, ""Many who have HIV initially have doubts about getting married, but, HIV does not prevent anyone from marrying, it only requires a little more responsibility and trust from both people in the relationship.""
, 
, Medications, new infections, family issues and failing health burden HIV-positive couples everyday. Yet they stand by each other, fighting tough.
, 
, Catherine, who contributes to the family income by selling vegetables she grows, says the couple has ""abundant worries"". ""We have short lives. And we have to think about the future of our child."" Janet, who works at the insurance firm where Melvin worked, says, ""Most of the challenges we face are perceived, not real. We make choices based on these perceptions.""
, 
, Two of the choices for the D'Souzas have been not to have children-""we didn't want to leave them orphaned""-and not to buy a house-""so the surviving partner would not be saddled with a mortgage"". ""I never thought long-term about changing my career. I am just happy we can support ourselves,"" says Janet.
, 
, Pereira says many people with HIV nurse dreams of marriage and living normal lives, but since they are unable to meet like-minded people, their dreams remain unfulfilled. ""Moreover, having a sexual relationship with your partner can cause tremendous anxiety if you are HIV positive."" She points out the contrast that people with other diseases and disabilities lead normal, healthy lives that include relationships and marriage.
, 
, Ask Janet what advice she has for those with HIV getting into relationships, and pat comes the reply, ""I don't think my advice would be different for 'positive' or 'negative'."" ""Honesty,"" she says, ""Is the most important thing you can bring to the table. And tolerance. And letting people grow at their own pace."" There's also learning how to argue. ""If you're agitated, walk away, and don't come back to the subject until you've calmed down and can hear each other's point of view,"" says Janet.
, 
, Melvin says it's important for couples to support each other in doing things they're passionate about. Also, ""toss aside the petty stuff and concentrate on what's important. When you are given a life sentence, you make sure every day counts"".
, 
, Dipak Kabadi, director of the government-run , (GSACS) says, ""There are half-a-dozen NGOs working to create awareness about HIV, and helping people living with the disease not to be stigmatized.""

"Updated: Mar 21, 2014, 00:53 IST",New untouchables: People with HIV,"In the run-up to the colourful slugfest called electioneering, a motley group of people cried out in the wilderness of our mushrooming urban jungle. Not just ill-informed and superstitious Khap Panchayats but even our educated and intelligent health service providers have apparently added a fifth 'varna' to our patriarchal, parochial, and stratified society. At the very bottom of the heap are the new untouchables - those who are denied c-sections, gallbladder and other surgical interventions, those who can't get broken bones mended - children, women, and men testing positive for ,.
 
, The first-ever survey conducted by HIV positive people (also called PLHA) on HIV positive people in Patna came to light recently. So much is the fear of being ostracized that 50% of those surveyed haven't disclosed their status to their family while 77% haven't disclosed their status to close friends. While 5% lost their share of property, 2% of the women were thrown out of their homes. As many as 34% of those employed face problems at the workplace after their HIV status became known. However, the majority of the survey sample consisted of those in the informal sector.
, 
, The , (CHMU) presented their findings on issues and problems of people with HIV and AIDS in a consultation attended by prominent members of the , fraternity, including representatives from state government bodies, NGOs, doctors, lawyers and so on. The report reflected the growing anxiety of PLHA and their families about the denial of surgical procedures and treatment by government doctors, some incidents of which have been highlighted in the local media.
, 
, By and large, BSACS (,) and the state government have ensured regular and timely dispensing of ART (antiretroviral therapy) medicines that PLHA need with 94% of the survey respondents giving positive responses about the facilities available in Patna (PMCH and RMRI). But no PLHA gets treatment for opportunistic infections from the PHCs (primary health centres). Greater coordination is needed between BSACS, government and civil society to address issues that go beyond the mere distribution of free medicines.
, 
, ""Doctors belong to the educated and enlightened section of our society, but there are among them (those) who practice untouchability vis-à-vis persons with HIV,"" said the report. The doctors attending the event claimed there were orthopaedic surgeons and gynaecologists in the city who have never refused to operate on patients with HIV, but these can be counted on the finger of one hand, says Chandy Joseph of CHMU.
, 
, The conference recognized that surgeons fear , by coming into contact with infected body fluids during operative procedures, and government hospitals are not provided good quality protective gear. It strongly recommended that the government supply adequate protective kits to surgical departments to deal with this issue.
, 
, Doctors Diwakar Tejaswi and A K Singh said the government should turn its attention to upgrading four key factors that impact PLHA and are linked to prejudice against them. These factors include doctors and training programmes, availability of post-prick prophylaxis, availability of protection kits and care and nursing services training for serving PLHA.
, 
, The doctors recommended that the government should conduct trainings and orientations for medical service providers and paramedics on how to provide services to PLHA, and enlist as resource persons surgeons such as Dr John Mukhopadhyay, Dr Manoj Kumar and others who regularly perform surgical interventions for PLHA so that there could be a sharing of ideas that will lead to a reduction in stigma and discrimination.
, 
, The conference also recommended that PLHA should be entitled to BPL status and accorded the entitlements by virtue of their condition in the spirit of the Supreme Court judgments. This status could be provided on the basis of the ART card. Special efforts should be made to ensure that the Right to Education Act norms of elementary education effectively covers children with HIV.
, 
, The positive attitude of the representatives of the PLHA attending the conference was remarkable. ""Yes, many of us face discrimination, even abuse, but we are not here to point fingers. Let's educate each other, understand our fears, and engage with civil society and government more actively,"" said Sanjeet Singh, the person who has successfully used the PIL route to bring relief to affected members of the PLHA community.

A small scale baby-wellness competition was part of the drive. Another message we wanted to spread among the parents and caretakers was though some of children are HIV+, they can live a normal life.

,
, The health of the , depends on a symbiotic/mutually beneficial relationship with ""good"" bacteria that live on its surface feeding on products produced by vaginal skin cells. 
,
, These good bacteria, in turn, create a physical and chemical barrier to bad bacteria and viruses including HIV. 
,
, The researchers are the first to grow human vaginal skin cells in a dish in a manner that creates surfaces that support colonisation by the complex good and bad communities of bacteria collected from women during routine gynecological exams. 
,
, The bacteria communities have never before been successfully grown outside a human. 
,
, By using this model of the human vagina, researchers discovered that certain bacterial communities alter the way HIV infects and replicates. 
,
, Their laboratory model will allow careful and controlled evaluation of the complex community of bacteria to ultimately identify those species that weaken the defenses against HIV. 
,
, The research group led by Richard Pyles at UTMB also indicated that this model ""will provide the opportunity to study the way that these mixed species bacterial communities change the activity of vaginal applicants including over-the-counter products like douches and prescription medications and contraceptives.""

But based on our studies of blood samples collected from 17 patients, we found that for 150mg of rifabutin to work, patients would have to take the drug every day,” said Dr Geetha Ramachandran, who led the study. , 	The subjects of the study were all patients at Government Hospital of Thoracic Medicine, Tambaram. All of them had failed to respond to first-line treatment. , 	Researchers found that the RNTCP stipulated dosage administered to seven patients was too low to counter the disease. Four of the subjects died during the course of the study. , 	“Ten of the patients, who received a dosage of around 30mg/ml higher than that prescribed by the RNTCP, showed favourable response to the treatment,” Dr Ramachandran said. , 	Experts say the dosage of the drug has always been a matter of debate, with doctors exercising extra caution due to possible chemical interaction of medicines for HIV and TB. , 	“While in some countries like the US, the dosage of rifabutin has been increased from 150mg three days a week to the same amount daily, in India insufficient data and studies resulted in health authorities failing to increase the dosage,” NIRT director Soumya Swaminathan said. , 	The researchers have presented the results of the study to the National AIDS Control Organisation. “A multi-centric study will be undertaken in different parts of the country to assess the effect of rifabutin. This could change the drug regimen for HIV-positive patients with TB,” Dr Swaminathan said. , 	Experts say 60%-70% of HIV-infected patients are likely to develop TB, mostly those on second-line therapy. , 	“There are several factors that may lead to poor treatment outcome, including malnutrition and other infections. The dosage of rifabutin, which kills the bacteria, is also a contributing factor which can’t be taken lightly.

The decision has been taken to promote birth of HIV-free children.
 
, The , (RSACS) has initiated lifelong multi-drug antiretroviral (ARV) regimens for all pregnant and breast-feeding , living with HIV. The transmission of HIV from infected mother to her newborn is one of the leading causes of spread of HIV. According to RSACS, it is estimated that 5.2% of total HIV infections are due to transmission of HIV from mother to newborn.
, 
, To deal with it, earlier the RSACS was providing single dose of Nevirapine to such women at the time of labour pain to prevent the HIV transmission from mother to her newborn baby. But, from May 19, the RSACS has changed its strategy.
, 
, Health department's project director (AIDS) Dr SS Chauhan said, ""From an HIV infected mother, the risk of vertical transmission of HIV to newborn is 30%. But, a single dose of Nevirapine reduces the risk to around 15%. So far we were giving single dose of Nevirapine to pregnant women at the time of delivery. But, still the high risk (up to 15%) remained the cause of concern for us. Now, to bring down the percentage of risk of vertical transmission of HIV from mother to her newborn, we have initiated the lifelong ART (triple drug regimen). The multidrug ARV regimen would further decrease the risk from 11% to up to 5%. It will be the major benefit of the new multidrug regimen.""
, 
, The triple drug regimen includes — Tenofovir, Lamivudine and Efavirenz. The three drugs would be administered to the women living with HIV and her infant. The drug would continue lifelong to reduce mortality and morbidity in mothers and children.
, 
, The RSACS is spreading awareness of HIV testing among pregnant women. They take consent of pregnant women for HIV testing. If the women test positive for HIV, they link the women with anti retroviral therapy centre. Also, they put effort to prevent the transmission of HIV to her newborn.
, 
, In 2013-14, the RSACS conducted HIV testing on 4.68 lakh pregnant women and found 412 women living with HIV. In 2012-13, the RSACS had tested 3.86lakh pregnant women and found 383 of them living with HIV. They have linked the newborns with antiretroviral therapy centres.

, Experts said there is an urgent need for partnership between the corporate sector and NGOs for improving public health and provide livelihood opportunities to marginalised sections. ""There is a sharp increase in cases of violence against sex workers. We are looking at involving corporates to provide funding to initiate an alternate livelihood skills mechanism for these women,"" said Dr P Prabhakar, director, India HIV AIDS Alliance, Andhra Pradesh.

, The bench comprising justices V K Tahilramani and V L Achliya observed, ""There can be no doubt that the offence committed by the accused deserves severe condemnation and it is a heinous crime, but on looking at the cumulative facts and on balancing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the case, we do not think that the case falls in the category of rarest of rare cases. Hence, we are not inclined to confirm the death sentence.""
, 
, On March 26, 2013, the district and sessions court at Islampur had convicted and sentenced him to death for raping and murdering the girl. The victim, a resident of Sangli, was studying in standard two in a local school.
, 
, The prosecution's case is that on February 26, 2011, the man had taken the girl from school to Kalammawadi, near Kasegaon in Walva tehsil and raped her in a sugarcane field. He then strangled her and fled to Pune. When the girl did not come back from school, her mother told her husband.
, 
, He inquired with the school teacher who had told him that she had gone with her maternal uncle. After a search, the girl's father registered a criminal case with the , station.

, Additional public prosecutor , relied on aggravating circumstances to prove that the accused had brutally raped and murdered a defenceless girl. She pleaded to confirm death sentence as the girl was last seen in the company of the accused.
, 
, She relied on the DNA report to prove that the blood stains found on the victim's frock matched his blood group.

"Updated: Jun 23, 2014, 10:11 IST",'Decision not to admit HIV+ students painful',"MARGAO: For an institution which has worked dedicatedly for the welfare of the marginalized young and the poor from the village since its inception, denying admission to the HIV+ students was definitely a painful one for the Sulcorna-based high school.
 
, Particularly because it was a reversal of its own conscious and bold decision taken only a few days ago to admit those students on ""humanitarian grounds"".
, 
, When the Salesian priests came to Sulcorna over 50 years ago, they transformed large swathes of jungle areas into a farm, growing sugarcane, cashew, and other cash crops, employing locals as farmhands and helping the needy.
, 
, Today the Don Bosco Agro-Ed Complex at Sulcorna, situated on a sprawling lush land, has grown into a hub of educational, agricultural and social activities.
, 
, ""Besides playing a pioneering role in the remote villages along this hinterland belt in the field of agriculture, horticulture, watershed development etc, the activities of ,, have always been village-centric. We have taken utmost care of the villagers all these years and the locals hold us in high esteem. We are always the first to reach out to them in their times of need. We have always fought for protecting the interests of the villagers. We have helped them form self-help groups and cooperative societies, besides helping the young in gaining employment. Though our students come from a poor background, they excel in studies and are on par with those from the urban schools. Our relationship with the villagers is close knit and we share a mutual trust,"" sources in the school management told TOI.
, 
, Sources within the local community confirmed that it was exactly because of the villagers' sense of attachment and belonging to Don Bosco school that they felt ""let down"" by the school management when it granted admission to HIV positive students residing ""far away"" from the village.
, 
, The school management is now concerned about the probable withdrawal of students by their parents in case admission is granted to the HIV positive students. The HIV positive students have also been denied admission in at least two other schools located in the vicinity of the children's home in which they are lodged, it is reliably learnt.
, 
, It was exactly because of such discrimination against HIV positive students that the Naz Foundation (India) Trust, an organization which runs a care home for orphaned and vulnerable children, had moved the ,, invoking the fundamental rights to life, education and equality guaranteed under the Indian Constitution.
, 
, The foundation had pointed out that based on their own HIV status or that of their parents or guardians, children affected by HIV face multiple forms of discrimination in schools. It was on this PIL that on March 3, the Supreme Court issued notices to the Centre and all states to declare HIV positive children as a disadvantaged group under the Right to Education (RTE) Act to ensure they got education without discrimination.

As they innocently await a new set of books and uniforms, the nuns who run the home are struggling to find a school willing to admit the children. 

, The problem arose when the nuns approached a school close to the home and the children were refused admission as 14 of them were HIV+. Despite there being two other schools closer to the institute, the nuns then approached a school in Sulcorna, that is about 15km away. 
,
, The , decided to admit the children, but ran into trouble when parents objected. Sources in the Sulcorna school management said parents of other students objected to HIV+ children sharing space with their children and threatened to pull out their children from the school if the HIV+ children were admitted. 
,
, ?Some parents even sought school leaving certificates for their children, school sources said. 
,
, Speaking to TOI, the head of the children's institute said, ""The parents believe that if their children mingle with children with HIV, they would be exposed to the infection."" 
,
, To allay such fears, Indian medical association (IMA) Goa state president Dr Jagadish Cacodkar had a session with the school's parent teachers association (PTA) to explain that ""merely mixing with HIV positive persons does not pass the infection"". 
,
, Some 200 PTA members attended the session and Cacodkar claimed they appeared satisfied with the explanation and reasoning. 
,
, Cacodkar said the opposition by parents was a result of misconception. ""The main reason parents object is because AIDS is incurable. The psychological fear of contracting a deadly disease coupled with misconception about its transition has compounded their ignorance. Their biggest misconception is that HIV is contagious,"" he said. 
,
, ""They were explained why it is not possible to get an infection if you touch a HIV positive person, share a seat with one or even when you eat from a common plate,"" he said. 
,
, Even late Friday evening, the nuns were in talks with the parents and the school management, and remained hopeful that all the children from their home will be admitted. ""I can say that 95% of the problem is sorted out. Consultative efforts to change the outlook of parents seems to be finally yielding results,"" the nun said. 
,
, Until last academic year the 14 HIV positive children were schooled in the home. It was only this year that, emboldened by the Supreme Court decision in March that asked Central and state governments to end discrimination against HIV positive children during school admission, the nuns decided to admit them in a public school. 
,
, While they almost succeeded, their attempt was derailed by parents. 
,
, How HIV spreads 
,
, The virus can be transmitted only through body fluids like blood, semen or breast milk. HIV cannot spread through saliva, sweat or by touching. The virus finds it hard to survive outside of bodily fluids 
,
, You cannot catch HIV by 
,
, Breathing the same air as someone who is HIV+ 
,
, Hugging, kissing, or shaking hands with someone who is HIV+ 
,
, Touching a toilet seat or doorknob after an HIV+ person

,
, Human Touch founder Peter Borges said, ""A few days ago those kids were part of my camp. I want to help them and have been in touch with Church authorities. Two years ago, a similar problem had cropped up at a children's home in Tivim. We spoke to the parent teachers association (PTA) and succeeded in resolving the issue. GSACS should play a more pro-active role to resolve this issue. I think the problem arose because awareness is lacking.

",Massive blow: 'Miracle girl' cured of HIV as a baby is suffering from virus again,"LONDON: A four-year-old girl who had emerged as the beacon of hope for the global fight against AIDS, when she was cured of HIV after being born to an infected mother has now been found with “detectable levels of HIV”. , In a massive blow to scientists, the child known as the “Mississippi baby” who when put on antiretroviral therapy (ART) within 30 hours of birth was cured last year by halting the formation of hard-to-treat viral reservoirs — dormant cells responsible for reigniting the infection in most HIV patients within weeks of stopping the therapy has now been found to have been re-infected after more than two years of not taking ART., , “Certainly, this is a disappointing turn of events for this young child, the medical staff involved in the child’s care, and the HIV/AIDS research community,” said NIAID director Anthony S Fauci. “Scientifically, this development reminds us that we still have much more to learn about the intricacies of HIV infection and where the virus hides in the body”., , A routine clinical care visit earlier this month has revealed that the child has detectable HIV levels in the blood (16,750 copies/mL). Repeat viral load blood testing performed 72 hours later confirmed this finding (10,564 copies/mL of virus)., , Additionally, the child had decreased levels of CD4+ T-cells, a key component of a normal immune system, and the presence of HIV antibodies — signals of an actively replicating pool of virus in the body., , The child was again started on ART. Genetic sequencing of the virus indicated that the child’s HIV infection was the same strain acquired from the mother., , , , , The child continues to receive medical care, treatment and monitoring from Hannah Gay, a pediatric HIV specialist at the University of Mississippi Medical Center who has been involved in the child’s care since birth., , Researchers say they will now work to better understand what enabled the child to remain off treatment for more than two years without detectable virus or measurable immunologic response and what might be done to extend the period of sustained HIV remission in the absence of ART., , “The fact that this child was able to remain off antiretroviral treatment for two years and maintain quiescent virus for that length of time is unprecedented,” said Deborah Persaud, professor of infectious diseases at the John Hopkins Children’s Center in Baltimore and one of the two pediatric HIV experts involved in the ongoing analysis of the case. “Typically, when treatment is stopped, HIV levels rebound within weeks, not years”., , , , , “The case of the Mississippi child indicates that early antiretroviral treatment in this HIV-infected infant did not completely eliminate the reservoir of HIV-infected cells that was established upon infection but may have considerably limited its development and averted the need for antiretroviral medication over a considerable period,” said Dr Fauci., , “Now we must direct our attention to understanding why that is and determining whether the period of sustained remission in the absence of therapy can be prolonged even further.”, , HIV first sprung its head over 30 years ago and has till now infected over 34 million people worldwide., , Finding a vaccine against HIV has been a daunting challenge., , The UN estimates that 330,000 babies were infected in 2011. This is apart from more than three million children living with HIV around the world., , In India, more than 14,000 children got infected in 2011, which accounted for 13% decline compared to 2009. The number of estimated deaths among children (0-14 years old) due to AIDS was 10,213 in 2011., , In India, children accounted for 7% of an estimated 21 lakh people living with HIV/AIDS in 2011. Around 40% (8.16 lakh) of them were women, who are likely to pass on the virus to their children., , The baby in question was born prematurely in a Mississippi clinic in 2010 to an HIV-infected mother who did not receive ART medication during pregnancy and was not diagnosed with HIV infection until the time of delivery. Because of the high risk of HIV exposure, the infant was started at 30 hours of age on liquid, triple-drug antiretroviral treatment. Testing confirmed within several days that the baby had been infected with HIV. At two weeks of age, the baby was discharged from the hospital and continued on liquid antiretroviral therapy., , The baby continued on antiretroviral treatment until 18 months of age, when the child was lost to follow up and no longer received treatment. Yet, when the child was again seen by medical staff five months later, blood samples revealed undetectable HIV levels (less than 20 copies of HIV per milliliter of blood (copies/mL)) and no HIV-specific antibodies. The child continued to do well in the absence of antiretroviral medicines and was free of detectable HIV for more than two years., , “The prolonged lack of viral rebound, in the absence of HIV-specific immune responses, suggests that the very early therapy not only kept this child clinically well, but also restricted the number of cells harboring HIV infection,” said Katherine Luzuriaga, professor of molecular medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School., , A Global Plan on HIV has two main targets for 2015: a 90% reduction in the number of children newly infected with HIV and a 50% reduction in the number of AIDS-related maternal deaths. The Plan focuses on the 22 countries which account for 90% of new HIV infections among children which includes India.  "
"Jul 14, 2014, 00:52 IST",HIV stigma: strategic long-term plan vital,"With the issue of , related stigma and discrimination being addressed in the state, I have attempted to put more light on the issue. There is need to understand the issue, not only in relation to the children who are facing discrimination, but close to 14,000 odd HIVpositive individuals found positive in Goa. Rivona case should help us to strategize for a long term impact.
 
, Goa had set an example to the rest of country three decades ago and had created an impact in addressing HIV-related stigma and discrimination. India's first HIV litigation arose when HIVpositive activist Dominic D'Souza was incarcerated in the late 1980s. D'Souza, a resident of Goa, was found to be HIVpositive when he donated blood at a Goa hospital. The test was performed without his knowledge or consent, and the results were revealed not to him, but to the local police.
, 
, D'Souza was subsequently arrested and confined in an unused TB sanatorium pursuant to the Goa, Daman and Diu Public Health Act, 1985, an amendment to which in 1986 authorized the state to mandatorily test any person for HIV and isolate them if they tested HIVpositive.
, 
, He challenged the Goa Public Health Amendment Act, which called for mandatory isolation of an HIVpositive person. He won a partial victory when the court ruled detainment was mandatory only in a ""justifiable"" case. His legacy continues through Positive, the NGO he started to help people living with HIV.
, 
, Dominic's case highlighted several aspects of the laws that are related to the HIV epidemic beyond the application (or mis-application) of public health laws. Dominic was tested for HIV without his consent, his confidentiality was breached, and eventually, when he was released, he had lost his job.
, 
, Since that first case, violations of the rights of people living with or affected by HIV have increasingly come to light, many legal cases have been fought and won or lost, and many judgments have been pronounced by the courts.
, 
, It should be understood that those who stigmatize people living with HIV falsely believe that the virus is highly contagious and that they could easily become infected. When that happens, others start to view HIV-positive as a threat. Many become isolated - within their homes, in public, at their workplaces. They are further stigmatized by others' assumptions about their moral integrity - such as the belief that they became infected with HIV because they chose to take part in risky behaviors.
, 
, Also, stigma and discrimination continue to undermine prevention, treatment and care of people living with the HIV and AIDS. It hinders those with the virus from telling their partners about their status. It threatens their access to health care. It increases their vulnerability to physical violence. And HIV-related stigma affects people's ability to earn a living, making it even more difficult for them to lift themselves out of poverty.
, 
, HIV and AIDS have highlighted such vast inequities, violent abuse and widespread stigma, that human rights have been violated in a manner and on a scale rarely witnessed before in the public health sphere. The HIV epidemic cannot be looked upon as just a medical problem. It touches on the most personal behaviours and aspects of people's lives, and its effect is felt in every sphere of a person's life. Combating it therefore demands an approach that integrates social, cultural, economic and human rights perspectives.
, 
, While we discuss this, I wish to bring to fore more issues related to this. Once an adolescent finds out about his or her HIV status, disclosure, safer sex and family planning become pressing issues, requiring services tailored to the specific needs of adolescents. Despite the growing importance of this population group, they are largely left out of HIV/AIDS responses in the state. One effect is that existing paediatric and adult services are often ill-equipped to deal with their complex needs.
, 
, This emerging situation underscores the need to recognize these adolescents in Goa as well, learn more about their lives, identify their preventive information needs and service priorities, and design appropriate programs for their special needs. Civil society organizations and the state at large, need to have planned and sustainable programmes for children, rather address issues as they come to the fore.
, 
, While, I highlight the above, I also wish to bring to the attention of public at large, some of the instances of stigma and discrimination faced by people living with HIV in Goa. Discrimination in medical setting is widely prevalent. Surprisingly, even I came across staff of an NGO working in the premises of GMC to provide services, identifying HIV patients and alerting others to maintain distance. Some who are availing 50% bus concession from KTC also face discrimination by conductors who sometimes grill them on the card and also deny them concession. Most of the migrant PLHIVs, including children are denied social entitlement and social security schemes. People accessing DSS schemes are constantly under fear and sometimes refrain from accessing schemes due to fear of status being revealed.
, 
, The government besides providing some social entitlements should also focus on long term HIV impact mitigation. It's high time that all stakeholders working to address HIV in the state come together on a common platform and address HIV through need-based, planned and sustained programmes. It requires commitment, courage and leadership at all levels.

, ""CRG is anguished with the response of the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) of , at Rivona, who are threatening to boycott the school if the management gives admission to 13 HIV positive students.

, The experiment, carried out with six HIV-infected volunteers, is an important advance in the so-called kick-and-kill approach for a cure, they said. 
,
, The technique aims to force the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) from its last redoubt after it is beaten back by antiretroviral drugs. These drugs can bring HIV in the blood to below detectable levels, enabling sick patients to return almost miraculously to normal life. But the therapy has to be taken every day, is costly and carries potential side effects. 
,
, If the drugs are stopped, HIV usually rebounds within a few weeks and starts once more to infect other immune cells, exposing the body to opportunistic microbes. 
,
, For the past three years, scientists have focused on ways to kick HIV out of its bolthole and then kill the hideaway cells. In a presentation at the International AIDS Conference in Melbourne, researchers from Aarhus University in Denmark described a step forward in the first stage of this process. 
,
, Six patients on antiretrovirals took an anti-cancer drug called romidepsin, which prompted virus production in HIV-infected cells to crank up to between 2.1 and 3.9 times above normal. In five patients, the level of virus in the blood increased to measurable levels, an important threshold. agencies

For the past three weeks, several patients claimed to have been turned away from the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres.
 
, Most centres have run out of stocks of Tenofovir and Lamivudine, both of which are crucial drugs prescribed in combination with a few others as the first-line HIV regimen. Tenofovir, in certain instances, is also used as a combination drug in the second-line therapy.
, 
, One of the affected patients told TOI that major centres at BYL Nair and Sion hospitals too do not have these drugs. “The shortage that started with bigger centres has now hit even the smaller centers at MT Agarwal Hospital in Mulund and Siddharth Hospital in Goregaon, who too have run out of , for the past one week now,” he said. “Without ART medicines, most HIV patients may fall sick as their viral load will increase,” he said.
, 
, Another patient said hospitals like JJ in Byculla and KEM in Parel are the only ones with some stock. “They too are giving the drugs only for a week,” he said. “There is no word from the authorities, including the Mumbai District Aids Control Society or Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) as to when the medicines will arrive,” he added.
, 
, Head of medicine at KEM Hospital Dr A R Pazare said that they had stocks, which should last for about a month or two. A senior official from MSACS said the shortage was caused by a delay in supply of the drug by one specific supplier. “We have got the stock on Friday and it has already been released to all the ART centers in the state. We have also provided MDACS with 21,000 tablets. Drugs should be available by Monday hopefully,” the officer said.

The widows, hailing from Ropar district of Punjab, also shared experiences of their life at the department on Saturday. , Representing a stigmatized lot, the three women recounted how they contracted the infection, eventually losing their husbands and the trauma ? mental and social ? they had to face thereafter. ""These women not just lost their husbands, but their families too. Because of their HIV+ status, they were stigmatized and mistreated by their in-laws. Getting them to tie rakhis was just our small attempt to reach out to the section they represent,"" said Daljit Singh, a first-year student of the department., , Assistant professor at the department Gaurav Gaur, who took the initiative, explained the thought behind it, ""It is an initiative to de-stigmatize people suffering from HIV/AIDS. Despite the kind of initiatives taken to dispel myths regarding the infection and the disease, people have a lot of misconceptions against such persons."", , ""People visit different places to tie or get rakhis tied on their wrists. As a gesture, some women tie rakhis on the wrists of armymen. We thought that we could involve HIV+ women.

"Updated: Aug 9, 2014, 17:39 IST",HIV positive patients made to run in circles,"PATNA: A National , Control Organistion (NACO) ad has caught attention of many: A five-year-old's HIV positive mom is lying unattended at a hospital. The boy rushes to the doctor's chamber, takes his coat and runs back. The doctor and nurse rush behind him. Back with mom, the child says he resorted to the ?theft' just to bring his mother's case to the doctor's notice.
 
, Has the message percolated down to the doctors? Apparently not. A 45-year old HIV+ woman died at the PMCH after being denied surgery to remove intestinal obstruction in September last year. Amid much hue and cry, the state health department promised a slew of reforms to ensure people with HIV were not denied healthcare for their other ailments, but they seem to have remained on paper. Even the Patna high court's prods in this regard have gone in vain.
, 
, Had it not been so, 45-yr-old Ram Kumar would not have been made to run from pillar to post ? from IGIMS to NMCH to PMCH, to be precise ? to get his urethra dilated. More than ten visits to these government healthcare facilities notwithstanding, Kumar remains untreated.
, 
, It was on August 4, 2009 that Kumar visited the IGIMS' urology department for the first time. Investigations were conducted on him. ""However, when it was discovered that I am HIV positive, I was told to go away. As my condition deteriorated, I visited the hospital again after four days. They again said it was not possible to operate me at the IGIMS,"" he said.
, 
, As the complications increased, Kumar visited a private doctor. He prescribed treatment for a year but the surgery became a must. Kumar went to the NMCH in December 2013. He was refused surgery there too and was instead ""referred to PMCH/IGIMS.""
, 
, To try his luck for the third time, the patient went to the IGIMS again and found history repeating itself. ""The machine through which the operation is done is not functional,"" Kumar quoted the same doctor as telling him this time.
, 
, In July this year, Kumar went to the PMCH which referred him to the IGIMS. ""I have lost all hopes. The private doctor says it is high time I got operated upon. If I die, who will be responsible for my death?"" Kumar asked TOI on Friday.
, 
, The doctors Kumar visited have written ""HIV+"" in bold letters on the top on his prescriptions despite the fact that the treatment protocol prohibits such ?announcements'. All that the doctors can write on such prescriptions is ?PLWHA' which stands for people living with HIV/AIDS.
, 
, Kumar's is not a one-off case. Raja Singh of Chhoti Pahaari at Patna has been endlessly waiting for a heart surgery. He even visited a private hospital where the doctors told him he should go to the PMCH since his was an HIV case. He has made several rounds of the PMCH's , since then. Intermittently, he was referred to AIIMS, Safdarjung Hospital and G B Pant Hospital (all in Delhi).
, 
, Gyan Ranjan, a social activist who has been taking cudgels on behalf of the people with HIV, says he gets 30 to 40 calls from such patients every week. They are denied surgeries ranging from uterus removal to orthopaedic restoration. A patient was denied endoscopy at PMCH last year, he said.
, 
, According to Ranjan, doctors at times frighten away the patients by cooking up stories. ""Two months back, a 40-yr-old woman of Chhapra went to the PMCH to get her stone problem treated. Doctors told her she would die on the operation table and she returned without treatment. Such cases are common in orthopaedic department too,"" Ranjan said.
, 
, ""After the death of a woman last year, the , promised it would allot an operation theatre for two days a week for surgery of people living with HIV. That promise has gone in vain. Doctors say they are not being provided safety kits while their hospitals deny this claim. The responsibility has not been fixed and, as such, the vicious cycle of denial goes on,"" Ranjan said.

"Updated: Aug 16, 2014, 09:39 IST",Trangender HIV deaths rise despite drop in TN fatalities,"CHENNAI: Has Tamil Nadu been successful in its battle against ,? Yes and no.
 
, The state recorded a marked decline in incidence of HIV infection and deaths from AIDS between 2009 and 2013 among both men and women. However, in what is both a pointer to the vulnerability of the third gender and an indictment of a failure in social inclusiveness, the mortality rate of HIV-positive transgenders in the state increased by more than 1,600% over the same period.
, 
, 
,
, 
, , (TNSACS) statistics, sourced by TOI through an RTI petition, show that 1,537 men and 814 women died of HIV/AIDS-related causes in 2009. Effective intervention by the state led to a decline in the numbers to 1,323 male and 595 female HIV/AIDS deaths in 2013, a fall of 18.42%.
, 
, Tamil Nadu — one of the four worst HIV/AIDS affected states along with Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra — recorded only seven transgender deaths in 2009. The number climbed exponentially to 113 in 2013.
, 
, If this does not appear to be strikingly high number, consider that the latest census statistics put the number of transgenders in the country at 4.9 lakh out of a total population in excess of 120 crore. That is 0.04% of the general population. By comparison, the HIV/AIDS mortality rate for transgenders by population in Tamil Nadu is 5.56%.
, 
, Also, activists say, the actual numbers could be far higher because transgender deaths are hugely underreported.
, 
, ""Social stigma prevents the reporting of transgender deaths,"" says A J Hariharan, founder of NGO ,, which works for the welfare of the sex workers and transgenders. According to the TNSACS data, the number of HIV-positive cases in the state dropped from 25,572 in 2009 to 17,055 in 2013, with the number of HIV-infected males decreasing from 14,835 to 9,868 and women from 10,665 to 7,127 over the same period.
, 
, The figures raise several disconcerting questions. Have Tamil Nadu's highly acclaimed efforts to stem the spread of the disease not been an unqualified success? Is social inclusiveness a myth when it comes to transgenders despite several government initiatives to bring the community into the mainstream?
, 
, Tamil Nadu was the first state to create a special welfare board for transgenders and provide them land, pension and separate ration cards. The Election Commission in 2009 created a separate entry for transgenders on voter lists. But transgenders say the welfare board has ceased to function.
, 
, ""It was after Tamil Nadu that other states like Maharashtra set up welfare board for transgenders. But unfortunately the board for all purposes does not exist,"" says R Jeeva, founder of NGO Transgender Rights Association and a former member of the welfare board.
, 
, Other officials say lack of awareness is probably the main cause for the rise in deaths of transgenders. ""The increase in deaths of HIV-positive transgenders is a concern. It is most likely linked to unsafe sex,"" said Dr Vijaya Raman, deputy director of Tamil Nadu AIDS Initiative (TAI).
, 
, But transgenders say they have little choice in the matter. Latha S, a 30-year-old transgender says she's a prostitute by compulsion and not by choice. While that may be true of most women and men who sell sex for money, individuals of the third gender — stigmatised, ridiculed and shunned — have far fewer chances of opting out of the profession than others.
, 
, Latha says she did not have an education and no one would give her a job. ""I have been in the profession ever since I discovered I was a transgender and joined the community,"" she says. ""Once I left home there was no one to educate me or help me get employed.""
, 
, Her job, Latha says, involves violence from drunks and rowdies. ""Customers often do not pay and policemen harass us and force us to pay a large chunk of what we earn for protection,"" she says.
, 
, ""I hate being a prostitute but I don't know what else to do,"" she says. What is worst, she says, is the vulnerability that she and other transgenders face and the constant fear it engenders.
, 
, Transgenders usually leave home when they are around 16 years old, says A J Hariharan, the founder secretary of Indian Community Welfare Organisation (ICWO), an NGO that works for the welfare of the homeless, sex workers and transgenders. ""They join other transgenders and are pushed into begging and prostitution,"" he says. ""Lack of basic education means they are unable to get jobs and the stigma attached to them means even manual labour is not an option.""
, 
, Hariharan says companies could, as part of their corporate social responsibility programmes, look to help transgenders. ""That would be empowering for members of the community because it would involve acceptance of the fact that transgenders are part of society and bring them into the mainstream, apart from giving them a livelihood,"" he says.
, 
, But the discrimination that transgenders face leaves them with little optimism that they could win acceptance and integrate with society. ""Social acceptance? I don't know if that is possible,"" says transgender Raji Sekar, 25. ""We can't even take a house on rent because few landlords would want transgenders as tenants.""
, 
, ""I did not wish to be transgender,"" she says. ""I was born this way and that is what people should realise for society to accept us,"" she says.
, 
, Her companion Ambika M, has bruises on her face and hands. She says a group of men beat her up a few days ago. ""We face intolerance all the time, so nobody cares about our safety,"" she says. ""Not a day goes by without a transgender being beaten up by customers or drunkards.""

The commission’s chairperson Samira Kazi said the department is exploring other possibilities of taking action against Prabhudessai. , 	When contacted by STOI, Prabhudessai refused to reveal what he had advised the villagers, saying only, “I’m responsible for the welfare of my village.” Asked if he had misinformed locals about HIV/AIDS, he said he would reply only to an inquiry against him. , 	Chief minister Manohar Parrikar recently assured the legislative assembly that action would be taken against the doctor, after Sanguem MLA Subhash Faldessai raised the issue in the House. , 	Before his retirement, Prabhudessai worked for the directorate of health services and also served in the armed forces. Post retirement he runs a private practice at Colomb, Rivona. Asked if he is open to the idea of children with HIV being given admissions in regular schools, Prabhudessai said, “It is a debatable issue.” He refused to elaborate, saying he did not want to answer such questions telephonically. , 	He informed STOI that he was registered with the Maharashtra Medical Council after getting his degree, as the Goa council did not exist then, and later he did register with the Goa council. It is mandatory for every doctor to register with the state medical council or MCI if they want to practice in India. It is also compulsory for doctors to renew this registration every five years. , 	The controversy over admissions to HIV-positive children raged for over a fortnight in June-July, and was finally resolved through government intervention. It saw over 40 parents withdraw their wards from the school where the children with HIV were finally admitted. , "

The ministry data shows that in neighbouring states like Maharashtra and Karnataka, where a larger number of women were screened, the percentage of women testing positive was significantly lower. It has been estimated that a mother has 30 per cent chance of transmitting the virus to her baby during pregnancy. The mortality rate among children with HIV is much higher compared to adults owing to their under-developed immune systems.

,
, The study builds on research conducted at UW's Department of Bioengineering in 2012. 
,
, Dr Kim Woodrow and her team were experimenting with electrospinning, a process where a charged fluid containing polymers and antiretroviral drugs is projected from a syringe and through an electric field. 
,
, The electric field causes the jet of liquid to break into tiny fibres, each measuring anywhere between 100 to several thousand nanometres, 'Gizmag' reported. 
,
, These then come to land on a collecting plate and combine to form a stretchy fabric capable of blocking sperm and, as the researchers discovered, carrying and releasing contraceptives and antivirals. 
,
, Because certain elements of the material can be controlled, such as the solubility, strength and size of the fibres, the researchers said that it may prove more versatile than other anti-HIV technologies currently in development. 
,
, One sample dissolved within minutes, an application that could protect against unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. 
,
, Another sample dissolved over several days, which could prove useful in sustained delivery of drugs, such as birth-control pills and anti-HIV medicines.

",Stock-out hits HIV treatment across India,"MUMBAI: Treatment for , across India has taken a hit, especially in Delhi and Mumbai, due to severe stock-outs of , reported at government-owned centres.
 
, Shortage of first-line (initial), second-line (advanced) and paediatric HIV drugs, besides crucial diagnostic kits, has prompted patient groups to send a legal notice to the government, pointing to the scarcity, gaps in procurement and supply of these drugs.
, 
, The treatment and control of HIV, including dispensing drugs and testing, is handled by the government-run public health programme through its 355-odd centres.
, 
, Of the over two million HIV-infected people in India, four states — Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu — account for 53%. More than one-third of them, or 7.5 lakh patients, are on the public health programme this year. While the medicines are available in the retail market at a cost, the ones dispensed at government-owned centres come free.
, 
, At certain centres in Mumbai and Delhi, partial doses of treatment are being provided to patients for a few days, forcing them to return frequently. Alternatively, drugs are being substituted.
, 
, Hospitals such as AIIMS, Safdarjung and LNJP in Delhi, and Nair, KEM, Siddharth and Sion in Mumbai have been grappling with shortage of these drugs.
, 
, 
,
, 
, Prices of first-line HIV drugs in the retail market has come down now substantially due to affordable generic medicines. The treatment costs lakhs of rupees for advanced therapies for certain patients. While, retail first-line drugs cost Rs 5,500 a year, the advanced and complex therapies come at around Rs 20,000 to Rs 2 lakh a year.
, 
, In a legal notice to the health ministry sent on August 22, the Delhi Network of Positive People (DNP+), representing HIV patients, has sought emergency procurement and relocation of stocks to government-owned centres experiencing stock-outs of ARVS, particularly in Mumbai. They have also sought strengthening and streamlining drug forecasting, procurement and supply chain mechanism to prevent future shortages.
, 
, Stock-outs have hit centres in Delhi, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Manipur the worst, Vikas Ahuja of International Treatment Preparedness Coalition, South Asia, told TOI. Drug supply has been erratic over the past few months, Ahuja said.
, 
, Bureaucratic delay in tendering, procurement and supply has been cited as the reason, besides the mechanism not being planned proactively and in a streamlined way.
, 
, As per NACO guidelines, patients adhering to the treatment should get the medicines for at least a month.
, 
, Industry experts say shortage of second-line therapy has existed in certain centres since 2012, and that of diagnostic kits since last year.

, A routine blood test during the pregnancy of Ruma (name changed) in 2007 revealed that she was HIV-positive. Shortly afterwards, her husband Binoy (name changed) also tested HIV-positive. Ever since, Binoy’s brother threatened the duo of dire consequences every now and then if they did not leave the house they shared with him.
, 
, “My brother in-law used to abuse me maligning my character. For the last few years, I have not even shared the common washroom,” she said.
, 
, “No amount of reasoning would convince him that we were taking all the necessary precautions since we also have a child. He and his wife would abuse and even physically assault us. Finally, on Saturday afternoon, my brother-in-law summoned a few locals who are known to him. After my husband returned from work, they caught hold of him and threw him out of the house. When I rushed to his rescue, one of them hit me on the head with a stick and I started bleeding,” she added.
, 
, “But nobody in our locality was aware of our disease until yesterday. I am afraid how I will run my family now. I don’t know how our daughter will continue her education either.”
, 
, The battered couple went to police, who helped them return home. There is now a police picket in the locality in Ghola. But the stigma of social ostracism in an area barely 30km from the city centre is a grim pointer to the , that still surrounds the disease.
, 
, The couple have a six-year-old daughter, who is not HIV-positive. They were making preparations to secure her life when their own blood relatives and one-time friends turned on them. On Sunday, the couple brought back their daughter from an undisclosed location where they had sent her fearing her safety when they were attacked on Saturday.
, 
, Local residents, however, came to the rescue of the couple. Basanti Malo, a member of ,, said: “The shame will be on us and not them if we cannot stand by them at their hour of crisis. We plan to hand over some money to the couple by saving it from our Puja funds.”
, 
, Pappu Roy, a local resident and a third-year student at APC College, said: “I will discuss with my friends how we can stand by them. We will have to first raise their confidence level so that they can live in the mainstream of the society without any sense of shame and fear. However, the question of how they will run their family and manage treatment costs is of utmost importance.”
, 
, “The couple says they are HIV-positive and that they were beaten up by the husband's brother. We have taken down their complaint. We will take strong action against the accused,” said Barrackpore detective chief C Sudhakar.
, 
, When a police contingent accompanied the couple back to their house, the accused were nowhere to be found. After ensuring that the couple was safely in their house, police left a stern message with locals not to bother them in the future.

""Considering the duration of sex work, highest positivity has been recorded among those who are in the profession of sex work for around 3 to 5 years. During the HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) 2008, the highest positivity of 6.25% was seen among new entrants (i.e. six months to one year of sex work).

, The , (NPPA) said it is withdrawing “with immediate effect” — a guideline that had allowed it to put price caps on crucial medicines — to comply with a government “direction”. The guideline had been issued on May 29, just three days after the Modi government was sworn in.
, 
, Although the NPPA’s sudden notification does not mention whether it is revoking the price caps which it had announced on 50 anti-diabetic and cardiac drugs in July, the development could have negative fallout, sources said. A wider and more serious impact will be that impending price controls on expensive treatments of cancer, HIV and tuberculosis now stand cancelled.
, 
, 
,
, 
, NPPA officials were not available for comment, but sources say the government succumbed to pressure from industry lobbies. The NPPA’s decision to impose price controls had been hotly contested; with the industry up in arms against what it said was “arbitrary implementation of the policy”.
, 
, In effect, NPPA has withdrawn guidelines for price control issued under Para 19 of the Drug Prices Control Order (DPCO) 2013, which authorized it to control prices of drugs that are not under the NLEM (National List of Essential Medicines) under “extraordinary circumstances” and in “public interest”.
, 
, 
,
, 
, In July the NPPA, in a rare invocation of the lesser-used provision, had fixed prices of 50 anti-diabetic and cardiovascular medicines. This was the first time the government had brought drugs, outside the national list of essential medicines, under price control. (Prices of 652 drugs under NLEM were fixed by the government last year under DPCO 2013).
, 
, The move had triggered of a series of protests and lawsuits from the industry against the drug pricing regulator as they feared more such action.
, 
, “In compliance with the directions received from the government in the department of pharmaceuticals ... The aforesaid internal guidelines issued by the NPPA on May 29, 2014 under Paragraph 19 of DPCO 2013 are hereby withdrawn with immediate effect,” NPPA said in its latest notification posted on its website.
, 
, The industry welcomed the move saying that the interpretation of the May guidelines was erroneous.
, 
, “We have always contended that the guidelines for Para 19 were erroneous. Para 19 is not the right provision for extension of price control as there is no public health concern which could have prompted the NPPA to invoke the provision,” D G Shah, secretary general of Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, said.
, 
, 
,
, 
, Though it is still trying to figure out its implication on companies, the industry body representing multinational firms, the Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India, said: “We appreciate the government’s decision to withdraw the guidelines on fixation/revision of prices of scheduled and non-scheduled formulations under Para 19 of the DPCO 2013. This welcome move tells us we are being heard and we look forward to working with the government toward a common goal.”
, 
, The industry expects that the NPPA will take a decision on whether to revoke the price reduction order, over the next few days. The next hearing of the OPPI court case against NPPA is slated for September 29.

"Oct 2, 2014, 00:30 IST","Encouraged by declining HIV cases, GSACS steps up efforts","Panaji: Though statistics provided by the Goa state AIDS control society (GSACS) depict a gradual decline in the number of HIV and AIDS cases in Goa over the last five years, GSACS has stepped up its efforts to reduce the number , cases in the state even further.
 
, Last year, 532 cases of HIV were registered in the state compared to 959 cases in 2009. A similar trend has been observed among AIDS patients with only 51 cases registered in 2013 compared to 184 cases registered in 2009. A total of 1,040 persons have succumbed to the deadly virus since 1989, when HIV was first detected in Goa. But, this is only the reported figure, while the actual number would be higher as HIV-related deaths at home or private hospitals are not reflected in the above figures.
, 
, , Dr , said that they have increased the number of anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centres in Goa. Earlier, there was only one main ART centre at the Goa medical college, Bambolim; but, in recent years, GSACS has set up link ART centres at Asilo hospital, Mapusa, Hospicio hospital, Margao, sub-district hospital, Ponda and cottage hospital, Chicalim.
, 
, Patankar revealed plans of upgrading the link ART centre at the Hospicio, Margao, to facility-integrated ART centre. This means that there will be a doctor and nurse at the centre and patients from South Goa need not travel to GMC for the initial CD4 test. He also mentioned of another link ART centre that has been approved for the Curchorem community health centre.
, 
, GSACS has tied up with nine NGOs to execute 16 projects in Goa to combat HIV/AIDS. These NGOs work with high risk groups like commercial sex workers, drug users, gay men, truckers, etc. GSACS is now adding two more projects with the focus on migrants.
, 
, Another new measure is towards HIV positive pregnant women. Earlier, these , were treated only at the time of delivery. Now, such cases will be provided life-long ART treatment and the child will be given treatment for at least six months depending on whether it is HIV positive or negative. “Presently, the mother to child HIV transmission percentage is about 2.5%. We want to make it zero,” Patankar said.
, 
, He also informed of another new initiative of setting up a new opiad substitution therapy centre at Hospicio, Margao. This centre is meant to wean drug addicts who use injections from syringes to oral drugs which are less addictive. Presently, there is only one such centre at Calangute which is run by an NGO.
, 
, GSACS is also adding one more ICTC (integrated counselling and testing centres) at Ponda. It already has 14 such centres all over Goa including three especially for expectant mothers. , AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has sanctioned 7.55 crore for GSACS to conduct its programmes this year, but the amount is yet to be released, Patankar added.

,To the unknowing, they are bright, young kids playing in their boarding house yard. Their greetings are spontaneous and warm, their faces appear cheerful but all 42 children of , at Tivim are ,. Most are orphans but all are victims, in some form or the other, of discrimination and rejection.
 
, The love and care they now thrive on comes from the nuns of the ,. Three nuns manage ASRO - the home for HIV positive children – which is a project of ,.
, 
, The home began with one HIV positive child in a residential house at Canca, Tivim, in 2002. That child died four years ago, the home is now a big building closer to Acoi and presently, there are 20 girls and 22 boys living there. Except for seven, all are on anti-retroviral treatment from the Goa medical college. Most of the children are migrants but there are a few Goans from the Vasco area. ASRO takes in children of all creeds and most are non-Christians, except five.
, 
, “There is a sad story behind every child here,” says Sr Coshav Rodrigues, in-charge of the home. “It is not their fault that they are HIV positive. Almost all of them got it from their parents.”
, 
, But forget society, even family can be unforgiving. There is one 14-year-old girl from a well-to-do family, who lost both her parents to HIV/AIDS. When other family members realized she too was positive, they admitted her to ASRO. Once they took her home on a festival day but would not allow their daughter to play with her. When they returned the child to ASRO later in the evening, the child was in tears. And resolutely silent. With Sr Coshav’s gentle probing, the child opened up. The nun later counselled the family which relented and now take the child home for three or four days sometimes. “There is lot of misinformation among people. But they realize there is no danger when we tell them that we live with these children 24-hours in a day. We want to integrate them in society but the children live with rejection. Some express their hurt,” says Sr Felcy Lewis, who is also the resident nurse at the home.
, 
, The oldest boy is 22-years old. He was admitted when he was around nine. He could not cope with studies and now works at the home. Except for the occasional cold, cough and fever, he keeps fairly good health. The youngest child is four years old who was admitted in June this year. She too is quite healthy. All children are taken for health check-ups to the GMC every month. But every six months, the children undergo blood tests at the GMC. In the last four years, only one child died at the home.
, 
, Though the project is run by Caritas Goa, people donate generously in kind by giving rice, dal, coconut, sugar, milk, biscuits and bakery products. Occasionally, the home also gets chicken and fish.
, 
, Waking up in the middle of the night to tend to a sick child is routine for the three nuns. But the boys and girls living under the same roof though in different quarters, are growing up. Naturally, there is the occasional display of affection. The nuns have to now cope with the possibility of the blossoming of love between the children. It’s a challenge they are seeking to address the only way they know, with love.

The slack supply could lead to there being no stocks left which could make HIV positive people very vulnerable to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) drug resistance as well, according to activists working with HIV positive people.
 
, The region has the highest number of HIV positive people and intravenous drug users in the country. According to the department of AIDS control (2013-2014) and as per NACO HIV estimates, the total number of new infected adults was 6,460 and there were 3,594 AIDS related deaths in the northeast region.

"Oct 15, 2014, 05:39 IST","HIV relief for only 52 orphans, destitute kids"," 	NEW DELHI: Just 52 orphans and destitute children have got the benefit of the only financial assistance scheme Delhi government offers to people living with HIV/AIDS. In a status report on children impacted by HIV/AIDS, Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights has questioned the complex eligibility criteria for the scheme launched in fiscal 2012-13. , 	A 2012 study by Delhi State AIDS Control Society estimates the number of orphans and vulnerable children in Delhi as 1,908, of whom 766 were infected with HIV/AIDS. Additionally, there were 1,142 children whose parents were infected with the virus. The data used in the DCPCR study was gathered during the period April 2010-March 2012 from nine antiretroviral treatment centres, Children Affected by AIDS (CABA) pilot scheme and two institutions providing residential care to CABA in Delhi. , 	The DCPCR study finds the coverage of the Financial Assistance Scheme for People Living with HIV/AIDS ((PLHA) of Delhi Government wanting in many ways. The scheme has so far enrolled 1,726 infected adults and children,14 orphan children who lost their parents to HIV/AIDS, 26 orphaned HIV-positive children and 12 HIV-positive destitute children. , 	A sum of Rs 1,000 is given as monthly benefit to PLHAs including infected children, Rs 1,750 to orphaned children who are not positive but affected by HIV/AIDS as their parents were infected with the virus and Rs 2,050 to orphans and destitute children infected by HIV/AIDS under the scheme. , 	However, the DCPCR study says there is need to reach out to more children. It is stated that the eligibility criteria are too complex for an affected person to fulfill. According to these, a PLHA has to be on one year of Anti Retroviral Treatment and has to provide proof of the same. Besides being a resident of Delhi for three years, the beneficiary must have an annual family income of less than Rs 1 lakh. In case of orphaned children there has to be proof of death of one or both parents due to HIV/AIDS. In case of a destitute child, proof of HIV positive status is mandatory. The child must also be found living in an institution in Delhi. DCPCR strongly feels these need to be reviewed. , 	“Often lack of papers like death certificate or proof of residence can hinder access to these schemes. If the process is simplified, more would be able to get its benefit,” DCPCR chairperson Arun Mathur said. , "

The findings reinforce the need for national health authorities to ensure timely diagnosis of DR-TB, especially for vulnerable populations and including people living with HIV, in order to curb primary transmission.   , 	What is alarming is, that it provides evidence that primary transmission is the cause of DR-TB in as many as one in four newly-diagnosed TB patients. , 	Primary DR-TB results from the direct transmission of DR-TB from one person to another. The prevention of primary transmission of DR-TB has largely been neglected during the development of TB control programmes. , 	These patients were exposed to DR-TB mycobacterium either in their communities or during their visits to health facilities as they have no previous records of receiving treatment for TB. , 	“In ‘hot-spots’ such as the slums of Mumbai, and among vulnerable groups such as people living with HIV, the DR-TB epidemic may be driven by primary transmission, rather than simply by a lack of adherence to TB treatment,” says Dr Petros Isaakidis, MSF principal investigator of the study. “The government needs to pay more attention to primary transmission of DR-TB, particularly in settings of high HIV prevalence and rapid TB spread. Promptly diagnosing and treating DR-TB is the solution to curb primary transmission.” , 	The data highlights the urgent need to address DR-TB among people living with HIV by systematically offering screening, drug susceptibility testing (DST) and access to treatment based on actual resistance patterns. , 	“We need to urgently prevent transmission of DR-TB to others. With DR-TB, treatment is prevention, and these findings should lead to a stronger focus on diagnostics and treatment of DR-TB, particularly in high HIV-prevalent settings,” says Eldred Tellis of the Mumbai AIDS Forum. “This is in addition to the fact that health authorities cannot afford to neglect TB infection control in overcrowded healthcare facilities like ART centres.”  , 	“This study comes at the right time. Studies like this are complementary to the national survey and are essential to get a close-up picture of the DR-TB epidemic in ‘hot-spots’ and marginalised populations,” says Dr Arun Bamne, co-author of the study and former executive health officer of Mumbai’s Public Health Department. “Such studies will help shape the national response with specific interventions for those populations most at risk of getting DR-TB.” , 	TB is one of the most common opportunistic infections and a leading cause of death among people living with HIV/AIDS. Undiagnosed and untreated drug-resistant tuberculosis is a major cause of mortality and morbidity among people living with HIV. , 	In September, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan formally launched the first-ever nationwide TB drug-resistance survey to get a better understanding of the disease in the country. , "

Later, the father of the victim lodged a complaint on the basis of the boy's allegations of unnatural sex., , Appearing for Birender, advocate Vijay Aggarwal pointed out that medical records clearly show his client never committed the offence of unnatural sex and he can't be held guilty for the offence dealing with spreading of infection because it is implicit that no sexual act took place between him and the alleged victim., , A magistrate who first heard the case found that the statements made by the victim and his father were contrary to the version given by the boy under section 164 CrPC. Though the magistrate acquitted Birender, a session's court refused to discharge him of the offence under Section 270 of IPC that deals with ""malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life."", , The high court while hearing the revision plea focused on the medico legal case of the victim and found no mention of any external injury in anal region, no pain, no bleeding., , The court also pointed out that once an act itself never occurred as per evidence, the knowledge of the accused to spread infection of a dangerous disease by doing such an act can't be accepted as evidence in law.,  "

,
, Though the study says that gay men in India have an HIV seroprevalence rate that is 22 times higher than the country’s general population, those surveyed have a different take. “It is better not to keep concentrating on HIV… I think it is important to raise the low self-esteem of MSMs,” one of the interviewees said. 
,
, Those who participated in the survey showed a high degree of awareness of HIV prevention. Nevertheless, they expressed concerns surrounding their mental health. Some complained of high levels of depression which they said followed after they had disclosed their sexual orientation. Changed behaviour of their family members, ridicule from peers and a sense of social rejection, said the interviewees, have taken a toll on their self-esteem. 
,
, The interviewees also pointed out lack of privacy in state-run STI clinics (health centres which deal with sexually transmitted diseases). Once their sexual identity is disclosed, the homosexuals often face discrimination and harassment. This, some stated, forced them into alcohol or substance abuse. As a remedy, most stated that they preferred individual counseling.

The consequences of stigma and discrimination are wide-ranging: being shunned by family, peers and the wider community, poor treatment in healthcare, psychological damage and negative effect on success of HIV testing and treatment, he added.
, 
, The doctor said that the HIV deadly virus can be tackled just like any other disease. “The government provides free counselling and antiretroviral drugs to such patients. These are available at the ART centres all over the country. If someone is suffering from frequent fever, skin problems or any other type of illness, he should immediately go for HIV test. Once the virus is detected in the human body, the person needs to consult a doctor. Eating healthy diet rich in protein and anti-oxidant can help a sufferer lead a long life. Also, one should go for CD4 count test every six month to keep a track of the level of antibodies in the body,” he said.

The man, a distant uncle of the child, has known the family for over 15 years and has been living in the same neighbourhood; he had recently rented one of the rooms owned by the survivor's family. , 	As she entered the room around 11am, the accused locked the door and allegedly attacked the girl. But the child fought back, screaming loudly, which apparently angered the accused. ""Enraged, he bit her when she tried to get away from him,"" the child's aunt said. ""She still managed to free herself from his clutches and ran back home in tears and told us about her ordeal. She had bruises that were clearly visible.""

""The wound can be classified as mild to moderate."" , 	Head of paediatrics at Sion Hospital Dr Mamata Manglani said chances of transmission in such cases are usually negligible. ""But a lot depends on the wound, its depth and if there was any fluid exchange such as blood,"" she said. Manglani added a PCR test could be carried out after a month to check the status, but an ELISA test after three months is mostly considered conclusive. , 	The accused has been sent to the DN Nagar police's custody.

"Updated: Nov 30, 2014, 22:04 IST",Barbers expose customers to HIV infection,"AGRA: Even after spending crores in creating , and , awareness, the precautions that must be taken against the deadly infection hinge on a razor’s edge. A quick shave could be a close shave. Hundreds of roadside , in the city use just one razor or blade for shaving several customers. This means that with just a nick by an infected razor/blade, a customer can contract fatal infections like AIDS and Hepatitis B and C. 

, Shockingly, there is no system or organization in the state or even across the country to check this unsafe practice. There are no checks on the barbers working at various public places, especially at railway stations, bus stands and government hospitals. Hundreds of customers unknowingly expose themselves to danger when they go to such barbers. 
,

,
, These roadside barbers can be seen at every nook and corner of the town using either straight razors with open steel blades, commonly known as cut-throats or disposable razors. They perform multiple shaves within a few minutes and do not bother to change the blade. What is more shocking is that even the persons who get themselves shaved do not ask for a new blade or a fresh razor. 
,
, “I shave at least 20 people every day. My customers are generally passengers who do not halt in the city but have come for a meeting or an exam. They freshen-up at public toilets at the station, get a shave here and go off to work,” said Sanju, a barber at Agra Fort Railway Station. 
,
, This barber was ferrying his equipment in a box and had placed his makeshift salon on his bicycle. Needless to say, there is no scope, even for sterilizing the equipment or razors. 
,
, The barber when asked about his knowledge on HIV and AIDS, he said, “Ye sab to galat kaam karne se hota hai, dadhi banwane se nahi. Or Itna sochenge to khayenge kya (These things happen because of wrong acts and not because of shaving. If we will think that much, what will we eat).” 
,
, He further asserted that he charges only Rs 3 from a shave. If he increases the rates, people will not come to him. 
,
, Similarly, a barber working outside SN Medical College was seen using the same old blade to shave patients’ relatives. What are the precautions he takes? His refrain is, “I clean the razor with warm water before using it on other customer. We also sharpen the razor on stones whereby it gets cleaned automatically,” said Daddu, standing by his small salon on pavement. 
,
, He also cited his meager income for not changing blades for each customer. 
,
, According to doctors, this unsafe practice by barbers is simply not on the same page as the HIV and AIDS control department. No educational sessions or workshops have ever been conducted for the barbers, who are barely aware of the damger of using the same blade on multiple customers. 
,
, “Prevention is the only viable way to control HIV spread, as there is no cure for the infection presently. The risk of infection spreading is low with razors, maybe two in 1,000 but nevertheless, it is advisable that only one with disposable blades should be used,” said Dr CP Singh, expert from the medicine department of SN Medical College. 
,
, He added that the general perception is that HIV is transmitted through unsafe sex, infected blood transfusions and mother-to-child. These are the second and third highest reasons for HIV infections. But HIV infections can also be passed through sharing of non-sterile sharp instruments such as those used by barbers, incision, tattooing, ear perforation, blood-letting, injections and acupuncture. These too have always been classified as “other” reasons for spreading the infection and therefore given less attention in the campaign against the spread of HIV. 
,
, “Though barbers do not carry out procedures that deliberately penetrate the skin but sometimes just a single mick or cut caused by the clipper or razor blade is enough for an infection to occur,” added Dr Singh. 
,
, The doctors when asked how safe is to clean or wash the blade before using, he informed that due to the lipid envelope that protects HIV from dehydration, the virus can survive on the surfaces of barbering instruments for a period long enough for transmission to occur, particularly in commercial barber shops. 
,
, Talking to TOI, chief medical officer HS Danu said there are no measures or laws to stop this roadside barbering practice all across UP. This is an ethical responsibility of the district administration and civic body to issue no licenses to these roadside barbers. 
,
, “But these days, they do not even halt at roadside. They ferry their salon on bycycles and its impossible to check such practices,” added the CMO.

Anti-HIV crusaders fear that substandard quality of free condoms alone can push up HIV prevalence. 

, Over the last few months, cash-strapped NGOs and community-based organisations (CBO) have raised the issue of inferior quality condoms with government agencies. 
,
, A Malad-based CBO has often written to National , Control Organisation (,), that inferior quality of condoms has rendered its distribution among transgenders useless. “Our workers are ridiculed for distributing condoms, which lack proper lubrication,” said Gauri Sawant of the CBO. 
,
, Quality assumes importance in Mumbai which has nearly 2.50lakh people in the high-risk zone and vulnerable to contract the infection. “Condom distribution is key to curbing infection among men having sex with men and female sex workers,” said Ashok Row Kavi founder of Humsafar Trust. “Super-lubricated condoms are not that useful. We must provide regular condoms with extra lubrication,” he said. 
,
, While NGOs are supposed to get 80% of condom supply from NACO, they are expected to forge ties with manufacturers to arrange for the remaining 20%. NGOs say due to payment issues they hardly manage to get private firms interested in supplying them.

HIV virus can stay in the human body without causing any trouble for years, but the infection can be transmitted to another person,” he added. 
,
, The study conducted by Marfatia suggests that nearly 68 per cent of spouses get infected because the disease was never detected in their partners. “Heterosexual intercourse is the commonest route of HIV transmission in India. The unaffected spouse could incur the infection for two basic reasons – either the infected person is unaware of the infection or the infected person deliberately hides the information,” added Marfatia. 
,
, Sixty-six HIV positive patients and their partners from in and around the city were studied during the research project. The study concluded showed that unprotected sex between spouses remains a major cause of HIV transmission. 
,
, “The transmission of HIV and , due to blood transfusion or reused syringe has gone down to almost zero per cent. Multiple sex partners and unprotected sex remains the major cause now. People have to understand that regular check-ups and discussing about AIDS can solve the problem to a great extent,” Marfatia said.

On being informed about his HIV status, the shocked man goes into a state of acute depression and even attempts suicide. Concerned over his condition, his family took him to a psychiatrist. On the advice of the shrink, his family then took him to a government ICTC (Integrated counselling and testing centre) for a HIV re-testing. This time, much to the relief of everyone, the man is found HIV negative. But it was only after enduring the trauma for a month. 

, District medical and health officials said despite the government mandate of conducing three tests for confirming HIV positive cases, most private centres conduct a single test, which can be misleading as it is done without pre- and post-test counselling. 
,
, “There have also been cases where people committed suicide or were taken ill after being declared HIV positive. Thanks to the single test carried out in most private centres for HIV testing, which often leads to wrong diagnosis,” stated Dr Ronanki Ramesh, additional district medical and health officer (, and leprosy). 
,
, “To confirm whether a person is HIV positive, a series of three blood tests need to be done in half-an-hour, including Coombs, SD bioline and Sigma tests. There are also other types of test kits such as Quickcheck, Elisa, Western Blot Tests as prescribed by the World Health Organisation (WHO). However, most private centres furnish reports after conducting a single test (Tri Dot test), which is not foolproof and people end up being declared HIV positive when they are not. Such wrong diagnosis can lead to disastrous consequences,” said Dr Kutikuppala Surya Rao, who specialises in HIV/AIDS. 
,
, “Moreover,patients are also not given pre-test and post-test counselling, which is an integral part of HIV testing. Triple drug ART regime is also skipped in some private centres and a single drug regime is given. Also, the private centres charge Rs 500 for this single test, which is done free-of-cost at the ICTCs and charge Rs 6000 for the ART drugs per month, which again is supplied to patients free of cost by the government. Monthly, on an average, around 10,000 HIV testing is done in government centres in the district besides the tests undertaken by private centres, which goes unrecorded,” said Dr Ramesh. 
,
, “Another challenge in the treatment of HIV/AIDS is that patients turn up at the last moment when they have no option but to be administered ART (anti-retroviral drugs). They visit quacks,” added Dr Ramesh.

The Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS) is taking measures to increase the number of tests for HIV among pregnant women. , 	There are 20% home births where they don’t lend an ear to the need of getting tested for HIV. According to health department officials, the institutional deliveries have increased significantly up to 80% but still 20% remain home-based deliveries. , 	An RSACS official said, “In institutional deliveries, the chances of HIV transmission from mother to child reduces to 2-3% if universal precaution of delivery and proper medicines to prevent the transmission of HIV are taken. Also, such mothers should not breastfeed their babies.” , 	There are 18 lakh pregnancies reported every year in the state. In 2013-14, RSACS tested 4.68 lakh pregnant women for HIV with their consent. Among them, 412 were tested positive for HIV and there was a risk of transmission from mother to child. In 2012-13, the RSACS had tested 3.86 lakh pregnant women and found 383 of them living with HIV. , 	Three years have passed but a 25-year-old Usha’s (name changed) tears still trickle down when she remembers the moment her newly born baby was declared tested positive for HIV. , 	She was a resident of Jharkhand before she was married to a resident of the city. “I came to know that I am HIV positive at the time of my son’s birth. He was born in a government hospital in Jaipur three years ago. When doctors tested him for HIV, they informed me that he is born with HIV infection. Now, like me, he is also taking medicines for the infection,” said Usha on the eve of World AIDS Day.

"Updated: Dec 1, 2014, 03:51 IST,Over 9,100 people in Assam have been detected with HIV positive virus at present, the state Assembly was informed on Wednesday. ",HIV poses challenge in elimination of kala-azar,"PATNA: The Centre and the state government have set the target of eliminating kala-azar, also known as Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) in medical parlance, by 2015. However, a study conducted by Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), an international NGO, says many a kala-azar patient are , positive, but are ignorant about it. Non-treatment of HIV weakens their immunity system, due to which even VL drugs do not show proper effect and are leading to relapse of VL. Incidentally, Bihar accounts for over 90% kala-azar (VL) cases in the world.
 
, The study published in an issue of an international journal, Clinical Infectious Diseases, says out of over 2,000 kala-azar patients screened in Hajipur, 117 were HIV positive. Only 68 of them had prior knowledge of it. The prevalence of VL-HIV was much higher in males (71.4%) than females (28.6%).
, 
, It may be mentioned here that another study published in August 2014 in Public Library of Science (,) had said that estimated chances of VL relapse in HIV positive people was over 25% after three years of treatment of kala-azar. The mortality rate of VL-HIV cases are also high. Even after four years of treatment of VL, 30% HIV-VL patients could not survive. There are also a couple of studies to suggest that early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV positive had bettered the results of VL treatment too.
, 
, These figures should be alarming because, according to an estimate, over 3 lakh people have HIV/AIDS in Bihar. The PLOS study says that the risk of developing VL in HIV positive people is 100-2300 times higher compared to non-HIV people. It added, “Screening for VL in HIV cases living in VL-endemic areas must also be encouraged.”
, 
, Experts say HIV test must become a part of protocol to treat VL. National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and the National Vector Borne , (NVBDCP) had been assigned the task of developing guidelines to this effect in the road map released to eliminate VL by the then Union health minister, Dr Harsh Vardhan. While the state government still awaits any such guidelines, state programme officer M P Sharma said, “As of now, there is no plan to include HIV testing in the VL treatment protocol. At present, we are concentrating on the guidelines given by the Centre.”
, 
, There is another issue of dosage of drugs. Recently, AmBisome (single dose treatment for VL) was launched in the state. However, experts say single dosage does not work well in HIV-VL patients. Dr Gaurab Mitra, who was one of the researchers of the study and works with MSF, told TOI, “Instead of giving it in one dose, we divide it into six doses. We believe and recommend the same in government protocol too.”
, 
, His argument also finds support in the study mentioned in PLOS. The study, in fact, suggested that the number of follow-ups be more for HIV-VL cases than the VL ones.

,With a large number of migrants pouring into Goa, the , epidemic is turning into a frightening reality as the state has registered about 30 percent cases of HIV infection among , including people from other states and foreigners. A cause for alarm is that though the number of HIV infections has decreased this year as compared to the last, the number of HIV patients has increased.
 
, From January to October this year, Goa registered 128 cases of non-Goans among the total 376 cases registered across the state. During the corresponding period of last year, the figure was 86 of the total 386 cases registered by October 2013.
, 
, Though the disease surfaced in Goa in 1987 when a foreigner was detected HIV positive with the second case being of a non-Goan in 1988, Goa has so-far registered 15,603 HIV positive persons. While Goa has registered 1,662 full-blown , cases up to October, a total of 1,041 patients have lost their lives to AIDS by September this year, states data prepared by the , (GSACS).
, 
, According to data gathered by GSACS, HIV infection is now prevalent in all parts of Goa. What is worrying is that in Goa, HIV is not confined to coastal belts, but has penetrated to other areas, too. The disease is no longer an urban phenomenon, but has spread to rural areas as well. The HIV prevalence is shifting its base from one taluka to other, every year.
, 
, In 2013, the majority of the cases was reported in the four coastal talukas: Salcete (18.4%), Mormugao (12.8%) in south Goa district and Tiswadi (11.5%) and Bardez (14.9%) in north Goa district during 2013.
, 
, But, by October 2014, Tiswadi in the north showed a marginal decrease with 5.3% prevalence, while Bardez in the same district has shown a rise of about 2.7% (16.2% in 2014). In South Goa, Salcete has shown a decline of 4.3%. The taluka has noted 14.1% prevalence as against 18.4% of last year and Mormugao a decline of 2.7%. Last year, HIV prevalence in this taluka was 12.8% which has decreased to 10.1% this year, GSACS statistic stated. Dr Vandana Patankar, project director, GSACS, claimed that a large floating population in Goa has contributed to the bulging figure of HIV-infected in the state.
, 
, People migrating to Goa from other Indian states raises the figure. The state has noted a spread of the disease largely by the sexual mode. While the state has a thriving drug trade on its coastal belts, there were very less number of people found affected with passing on the needles used for injecting narcotic drugs, she admitted.
, 
, “Besides, most of the people from other Indian states come to Goa to get their blood sample checked as Goa has better facilities than other states,” Patankar said.
, 
, She also said that Goa has proper counseling, awareness-raising measures, accurate testing facilities across the state and anti-retroviral treatment (ART) center at Goa medical college and hospital, Bambolim. There are 3,476 people including 1,962 males, 1,327 females, 183 children below the age of 14 years and four transgenders have registered for the ART, statistics point out.

"Updated: Dec 1, 2014, 05:02 IST","Medicines, test kit scarcity hits HIV therapy","NEW DELHI: Even as the world commemorates , on Monday to continue its fight against ,, many patients in India are struggling for their daily dose of medicine or for tests to monitor the status of the infection.
 
, India has managed to bring down new HIV cases over the past five to six years by bringing in more patients under treatment and promoting use of condoms, mainly among the vulnerable population such as sex workers, drug addicts and transgenders. However, inconsistency in supplies and frequent stock outs of lifesaving HIV medicines in government owned centres in major cities like Delhi, Mumbai and the northeast have the potential to put India back in the danger zone, experts warn.
, 
, “Once a patient starts the therapy, medicine needs to be taken daily with proper adherence, or else the drugs quickly lose their effectiveness. Once this happens, HIV patients have to switch to a second line of treatment which is five times more expensive than first-line drugs, adding an additional burden on our healthcare system,” said Daisy David, advocacy officer, World Vision India.
, 
, Moreover, there is also a severe dearth of testing kits like CD4 and viral load, which are crucial for patients to monitor the virus and ascertain the stage of infection. “These tests are important because they help a doctor ascertain when to change the line of treatment for particular patients. In the absence of these tests, a patient may develop resistance to a certain medicine or line of treatment and hence develop the virus again,” said Vikas Ahuja, president of Delhi Network of Positive People, a trust that works with HIV/AIDS patients.
, 
, A , (,) report last year said the Indian government was providing free anti-retroviral drugs for treating HIV since 2004, but only 50% of those eligible were getting it in 2012.
, 
, According to Anand Grover, founder-president of Lawyers Collective, a faulty procurement policy, withdrawal of global funding from India and other middle income countries and discrimination with the vulnerable population including sex workers and drug addicts were major causes leading to such problems.
, 
, The health ministry recently told Lok Sabha that though there were shortages, it had resolved the issue for the time being by procurement and donations from a domestic pharmaceutical company. The ministry has also initiated a computerized supply chain management system for assessment of drug requirement and their stocks.
, 
, The latest data from National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) shows there are over 2.09 million HIV patients in India, with the north, south and northeast regions accounting for the majority of patients. The government receives nearly $80 million from the Global Fund, an international aid organisation for HIV prevention and treatment.
, 
, The United Nations estimates India currently has the third largest population of people living with HIV in the world. However, NACO data shows a significant decline in prevalence of HIV among adults across the country. At national level, prevalence was estimated at 0.41% in 2001, whereas it dropped to 0.35% in 2006 and 0.27% in 2011, latest data with the department showed.
, 
, Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, WHO South-East Asia, said stigma, discrimination and restrictive laws continued to be barriers to accessing prevention, care and treatment services. “The HIV epidemic in our region is concentrated among populations most vulnerable to HIV: men who have sex with men, transgender people, people who inject drugs, sex workers, people in prisons and other closed settings. Although we have been successful in scaling up the health sector response for the vulnerable populations, more needs to be done. Less than 50% of these people know their HIV status,” she said.
, 
, Though the government is hopeful the HIV and AIDS bill, drafted in 2006, which was tabled in the Rajya Sabha in February and is currently being considered by a parliamentary standing committee, will address most of these issues, Grover said even the draft bill keeps people with HIV and AIDS out of the purview of free medicines.
, 
, “Just by ignoring the issue, the government cannot tackle the real menace of the disease. It needs to guarantee access to medicines for all,” Grover said.

"Updated: Dec 2, 2014, 19:04 IST,According to the World Health Organization, there were a total of 35 million people living with HIV worldwide in 2013.","HIV losing its edge, evolving into milder form, study finds","LONDON: One of the world’s most feared virus is losing its edge. , is evolving to become less deadly and less infectious, according to a major scientific study led by British scientists.
 
, The team at the , has shown that it was taking longer for HIV infection to cause ,.
, 
, The rapid evolution of HIV, which has allowed the virus to develop resistance to patients’ natural immunity is at the same time slowing the virus’s ability to cause AIDS.
, 
, The study also indicates that people infected by HIV are likely to progress to AIDS more slowly — in other words the virus becomes less virulent — because of widespread access to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Both processes make an important contribution to the overall goal of the control and eradication of the HIV epidemic.
, 
, Scientists said: “Twenty years ago the time to AIDS was 10 years, but in the last 10 years in Botswana that might have increased to 12.5 years. One might imagine as time extends this could stretch further and further and in the future people being asymptomatic for decades.”
, 
, In 2013, there were a total of 35 million people living with HIV worldwide according to the World Health Organization.
, 
, The study was led by researchers at the University of Oxford, along with scientists from South Africa, Canada, Tokyo, , and ,.
, 
, 
, 
,
, 
,
, 
, 
,
, 
, Lead scientist Professor Phillip Goulder from the University of Oxford, said: “This research highlights the fact that HIV adaptation to the most effective immune responses we can make against it comes at a significant cost to its ability to replicate. Anything we can do to increase the pressure on HIV in this way may allow scientists to reduce the destructive power of HIV over time.”
, 
, 
,
, 
,
, 
, The research was carried out in Botswana and South Africa, two countries that have been worst affected by the HIV epidemic. Across those countries, researchers enrolled over 2000 women with chronic HIV infection to take part in the study.
, 
, The first part of the study looked at whether the interaction between the body’s natural immune response and HIV leads to the virus becoming less virulent.
, 
, 
,
, 
, Central to this investigation are proteins in our blood called the human leukocyte antigens (HLA), which enable the immune system to differentiate between the human body's proteins and the proteins of pathogens. People with a gene that expresses a particular HLA protein called ,, are known to benefit from a protective effect to HIV.
, 
, Infected patients with the HLA-B57 gene progress more slowly than usual to AIDS.
, 
, 
,
, 
,
, 
, This study showed that in Botswana, where HIV has evolved to adapt to HLA-B57 more than in South Africa, patients no longer benefit from this gene’s protective effect.
, 
, However, the team’s data show that the cost of this adaptation to HIV is that its ability to replicate is significantly reduced, therefore making the virus less virulent.
, 
, The authors show that viral adaptation to protective gene variants, such as HLA-B57, is driving down the virulence of transmitted HIV and is thereby contributing to HIV elimination.
, 
, In the second part of the study the authors examined the impact of ART on HIV virulence. They developed a mathematical model, which concluded that selective treatment of people with low CD4 counts will accelerate the evolution of HIV variants with a weaker ability to replicate.

"Updated: Dec 1, 2014, 00:45 IST",New therapy to cut down HIV drug dose from 3 pills to 1,"Lucknow: A new protocol for management of , AIDS will be launched across AAL anti-retro-viral therapy (ART) centers across UP reducing the number of pills from three to one. It also promises relief to patients from severe side effects caused by drugs prescribed under ART.
 
, HIV-AIDS patients would be put on , (FDT) in which a single pill would be given in place of three drugs that cause side effects and will reduce pressure on kidney and liver.
, 
, Speaking with TOI ahead of the world HIV , Awareness Day, Indian Society of Haemetology and Blood Transfusion president A K Tripathi said, “FDT will soon be introduced across all ART centers across UP. In King George's , it will be launched in mid-December.”
, 
, The single pill, often referred to as the wonder drug in AIDS treatment, comprises three medicines given as first line of treatment. Also, salts used in them are better than the previous formula. One of these three (stavudine) was known to cause lipid abnormalities and neuropathy. As a result, fat deposits occur in the patient’s body in specific places while it dries up in other (lipodystrophy) leading to severe disfigurement. Blood cholestrol levels also go up posing risk to heart health and causing burning sensation in hands and feet. Stavudine has been replaced with tenofovir.
, 
, The other salt called nevirapine had three major side effects, including damage to liver, severe allergic reaction and interference in treatment of tuberculosis. This salt has been replaced with effavirenz. The third medicine called lamivudine has been retained as it is.
, 
, A policy decision to this effect was taken in May 2013 and was implemented later. It is now being launched in UP. “Side effects tend to compel patients to skip medicines, which compromises the adherence rate. Success of the aids control programme cannot be guaranteed unless adherence rate is above 90% which the wonder drug helps achieve,” explained Dr Tripathi.
, 
, Besides introducing this drug, , has introduced changes in the treatment guidelines which promise better success of the programme. One of them, which relates to pregnant women, says they should all be tested for HIV AIDS and if found positive, should be put on ART irrespective or the CD4 count reading.
, 
, It may be noted that CD4 count is the parameter for putting a patient on ART. Till 2013 a CD4 count of 250 made an HIV-positive person eligible for ART. After a revised order, a CD4 count of 350 meant clearance for ART. The new guidelines also overlook CD4 count for HIV positive persons diagnosed of TB.

To cater to the needs of such patients, government has come with a lot of schemes. The medicines and treatment is available for free at the Antiretroviral therapy (ART) Centre situated in the city. Also, free medical assistance is provided to the suffers in all departments of the hospital,” he said. 
,
, Talking about epidemiology of HIV/AIDS ART Centres, Dr BP Priyadarshini, Nodal officer ART Centre, said that the country has been fighting with the disease from the past 28 years. He said that it is a chronic manageable disease. “There are total 680 ART Centres in the country. States like Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra have maximum number of HIV patients. From 2010, when the centre was opened in the city, we have registered about 4,400 patients, out of which 2,900 are being provided with free medicines,” he said. 
,
, Meanwhile, District Tuberculosis Control (DTC) centre also organised various activities to mark the day. An inter-college ‘Street lay’ competition was organised to spread awareness among the youngsters as well to the society. “HIV/AIDS sufferers are at high risk of developing TB. Therefore, it is important that they know about the precautions that should be taken to prevent the disease. Our main motive behind organising the competition was to create awareness among the youth”, Dr. Anil Kumar Saxena, DTO, said. 
,
, Local NGOs also came forward in making the society aware about the preventive measures to be taken to check the spread of the disease. An Etawah based NGO took out a rally from DTO office at Parade area to Ursula Hospital. A signature campaign was also organised by the NGO at LLR hospital premises. Around 150 people took pledge to help HIV/AIDS sufferers and spread awareness about the same in the society.

Not only is the incidence declining among the high risk groups, but also observed among the general population. 

, Confirming this, officials from the AP State , (,), Hyderabad, and District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU), Vizag, said the incidence has declined not only among the vulnerable high risk groups (HRG), MSMs (homosexual males) and injectible drug users (IDUs), but also among the general population, including pregnant women, that underwent tests for HIV. 
,
, Incidentally this year’s National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) theme for World AIDS Day is ‘Zindagi Zindabad’ targeting zero stigma, zero new infections and zero AIDS deaths. 
,
, ""Four-five years ago, out of 100 people who tested for HIV, three-four would test positive but now two people are testing positive out of every 100 undertaking HIV tests in the district. Also, more and more people are coming for getting tested. Similarly, 0.2 per cent pregnant woman are now testing positive for HIV, which was around 0.7 per cent 4-5 years ago. This prevalence is more in urban areas than rural and Agency areas,"" said Dr Ronanki Ramesh, additional district medical and health officer (ADMHO, AIDS and leprosy).

In last six years time, highest 338 HIV positive cases were diagnosed in 2012. Total number of HIV cases in under 14 years of age group since 2008 has reached 2,152.
, District nodal officer (AIDS) Dr Vijay Chajjlani said, “Rising number of HIV cases in less than 14 years of age group is definitely a matter of concern. Two children were recently diagnosed HIV positive due to unsafe blood transfusion and syringe use.” “People should ensure taking blood only from registered blood banks and fresh syringe should be used everytime,” he added. There has also been a spurt in number of pregnant women coming forward for integrated counselling and testing since 2010, say health department data. However, the overall figure of HIV positive population, including general and pregnant women continues to be stagnant in comparison to the past few years. “People, especially pregnant women are more aware and they are coming in large numbers for voluntary counseling and testing. Also, decreasing percentage of people, who have tested positive to HIV in past few years is a good sign,” said the chief medical and health officer Dr Ashok Dagaria.

"Dec 9, 2014, 04:00 IST",Sensor measures HIV-cell real time to stop spread of infection,"Bengaluru: An HIV-affected person doesn’t immediately develop AIDS; in fact it’s the final stage. However, as HIV-1 has a unique ability to lie dormant for years, the virus-affected cells will have to be continuously monitored to plan the treatment. So, here comes a non-invasive biosensor that can measure what is going on within HIV-1 infected cells in real time, all thanks to a joint research by teams from IISc here and the International Centre for , Engineering & Biotechnology (ICGEB) and Jamia Millia Islamia in New Delhi. Scientists said that the technology can offer insights that can help in controlling AIDS infection and also provide insight on interactions between HIV-1 and the , causing bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb),within the cells. 

, The team has devised a non-invasive biosensor methodology for precise measurements of glutathione (GHS), an anti-oxidant which works as a protective shield. Glutathione levels are indicators of the level of infection. The team says fluctuation of GSH levels detected by the biosensor also helps understand the expression of antioxidant genes and related , during latent and active stages of infection. “Earlier methods use whole cell or tissue extracts, which destroy detailed information related to the GSH levels in different areas within an infected cell. We’ve discovered that a modest increase in oxidative stress is sufficient to reactivate virus from latency. This may allow researchers to adopt a ‘shock-and-kill’ strategy in which virus could be reactivated by oxidative stress inducing compounds and subsequently killed by current anti-HIV drugs,” the team’s study says. Amit Singh of IISc says the sensitivity and specificity of this biosensor could be further used in understanding the physiological changes in HIV-1 infected cells and the mechanism of drug action. Importantly, he says, “We also discovered that Mycobacterium tuberculosis, another major human pathogen, specifically disturbs glutathione balance to increase the replication of HIV. Since TB is the major cause of HIV related deaths, our findings have major mechanistic and therapeutic potential for both TB and AIDS (among the main causes of human death).”

But, what’s bothering doctors and counsellors working with people living with HIV/AIDS is the casual attitude of the infected persons.
 
, Despite counselling, many don’t take any precautions and pass on the infection to his/her partner. The ART (anti-retroviral therapy) center located in , (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, receives many such cases.

She even evaded questions on the cause of their father's death until the day her 15-year-old daughter found a hospital file and asked her mother about the medicines she was taking., , ""I was surprised that my daughter did not get angry. She has learnt about HIV at school. In fact, she was supportive and said she would take good care of me. She suddenly sounded all grown up when she told me not to reveal about my health status to her sister,"" Ramani said., , Not many parents with HIV reveal their health status to their children. A study by National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis found that only 24% of people with HIV disclosed their status to their children. The study involved interviews with 115 parents with HIV. Those who disclosed it did so only to protect their children from risky behaviour or in the hope that they would be taken care of when they fall ill., , While the rest did not reveal their status to their children because they were afraid of losing respect or being treated with indifference, the study highlighted the need to teach healthcare providers to help patients with full disclosure., , Only 39% were able to disclose their status by themselves; in the rest of the cases, children came to know of their parents' health condition on their own during hospital visits, reading case files or overhearing conversations between the parent and the health provider., , The study said the trend was worrying as improper disclosure without clear explanations could frighten a child, , . Most of the disclosures were by those widowed, separated or divorced where the child would already be going through a trauma of a broken family, , . Disclosure was also more likely where both parents were positive., , Not all children were accepting and understanding of their parents' health status. At least half of those who disclosed, witnessed angry or mixed reactions from children. One-tenth of the parents who did not disclose had children who were HIV positive, leaving them with more burden of keeping even their child's status under wraps that can be detrimental to the psychosocial well being of parents and their children, , *(Name changed), , ""Anti-retroviral treatment reduces morbidity and mortality and disclosure becomes significant as positive parents are more likely to raise their children for many years. However, HIV programmes do not address the psycho-social concern regarding disclosure,"" said Beena Thomas, scientist, NIRT. ""Disclosure is important for emotional and social support and better quality of life. Once the disclosure is made, children need to be equipped to deal with the status through periodic interventions and counselling.

""Our focus is now on match-making so that the young people living with HIV/AIDS can lead a positive life,"" he said.

The prospects are bachelors as well as the ones who are in their widowhood,"" Patil said.

They both adopted each other with their children and that started off the marriage. ""There are common queries about trying to look for people from the same castes.

The boy from Midnapore was abandoned by his family after his parents succumbed to AIDS. 

, Today Mahesh is 18. As Mahesh and some other inmates of Anandaghar, run by Organisation for Friends, Energies & Resources (OFFER), step into adulthood, they aspire to stand on their own feet. They hope vocational and skill development training that OFFER has been giving along with formal education could help them earn a living. 
,
, “We fought the resistance in admitting them in schools because of their ‘HIV positive’ status. In addition, we have also been providing vocational training to older children so that this would help them in future. Our aim is to place them in suitable jobs once they are ready,” says Kallol Ghosh, founder secretary of OFFER. 
,
, Since 2004, Anandaghar has been taking care of ‘HIV positive’ orphans, unwanted even by their own families. Currently there are 70 such children at the home that provides, apart from food and shelter, education along with clinical care for HIV. But the organization is now staring at a bigger task — rehabilitating the children who are 18 years and above by getting them placement— in a rare initiative to get such children back in mainstream. 
,
, Bajoria Charitable Foundation (BCF) that has been supporting OFFER is also keen on this rehabilitation project. BCF founder Namit Bajoria, who runs a kitchen appliances chain Kutchina, intends to identify skills in these children and improve them before placing them in jobs. 
,
, “To begin with, we can place some of them in back office or in outlets in the city. As and when they learn the job they could be given bigger responsibility. The aim is not only financial assistance, but to make these children part of the mainstream society,” says Namit Bajoria. 
,
, At OFFER these children are being trained at skills like computer operation, bakery and house-keeping etc. OFFER has started approaching corporate houses and other organisations to tie up for the rehabilitation project. But apart from Kutchina and a handful of MNCs, the response has not been very encouraging. 
,
, The prospect of earning bread and butter on their own is already a reason for excitement for the likes of Pratik Sarkar. The boy, who was rescued from Cooch Behar after being driven out of home five years ago, wishes to join a driving school once he completes 18 years in a few months to earn his living as a driver. There are 17 other children who are nearing 18 years of age and are looking forward to land suitable jobs. 
,
, “I have my limitations to provide jobs to all of them. But I want to make a beginning so that this will evoke response from like-minded people and organisations,” says Bajoria. Even after these children start earning, OFFER will continue to monitor them, especially their medical care. Most of them are on ART (antiretroviral) drugs and need to maintain a reasonably good CD count to fight the virus.

","1,000 HIV+ cases in Maharashtra due to infected blood transfusion","MUMBAI: The ,, in an RTI response, has revealed that nearly 1,000 people contracted the human immunodeficiency (,) virus in Maharashtra due to transfusion of infected blood over the past five years. The state has earned the dubious third position after Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat to report this alarming trend, raising a serious question over the quality of blood transfused to unsuspecting patients.
 
, The shocking disclosure comes at a time when the , have had people believe that transfusion-transmitted infection has almost been eliminated. The RTI response showed that between April and October 2014, around 629 people across the country, including 80 in the state, got HIV through blood transfusion. The cumulative count for the past five years is 8,983 people who got HIV through , in India.
, 
, The data collected from , (ICTC) through voluntary disclosure of clients, though, has raised a storm among the HIV-fighting agencies at the state and the Centre. While officials have questioned its veracity, activists insist the numbers expose the glaring lack of accountability when it comes to ensuring quality of blood supplied by blood banks. Interestingly, nodal agencies such as the State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC) and the Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) have put the onus on each other to ensure blood banks play by the rule and detect every HIV case.
, 
, Experts say a fundamental problem is the fact that HIV in most blood banks is still tested through enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay test (ELISA) that has an innate shortcoming. “If a person has recently contracted HIV, this test may not show. It can detect HIV antibodies that take a minimum of three months to show in the blood. So if a person donates blood, it will end up getting transfused,” said an ICTC staffer from Parel’s KEM Hospital.
, 
, “Due to financial constraints, most blood banks have not graduated to advanced tests such as nuclear acid testing (NAT) that cut down the HIV detection window period from few months to a week,” said Vinay Shetty of NGO Think Foundation. Currently, only a handful of the city’s leading private hospitals offer NAT-tested blood, which again comes at a premium fee of at least Rs 1,200 per unit. “None of the state-run and BMC blood banks, however, have this facility,” he said.
, 
, 
,
, 
,
, 
, In fact, there is also a worrying amount of negligence while conducting and then screening blood, said a senior technician from a leading blood bank. “Any person who tests positive for HIV during a donation camp is seldom informed about his status or referred to an ICTC centre, although both are mandatory. Therefore, that person goes about donating several times till he is detected at some point,” said the technician, adding that several youngsters, in fact, bank on blood camps to find out about their status. “Once they do not get follow-up calls, they go about things normally,” he added.
, 
, Officials from the SBTC, though, feel the numbers are not that bad given that there are 11 lakh donations on an average annually. “How much can we trust voluntary disclosures by people who may be unwilling to disclose how they actually contracted the virus? Also, SBTC’s role is to ensure blood is available for everyone. The infection part is dealt with by MSACS,” said Dr Sanjay Jadhav, director, State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC).
, 
, MSACS, on the other hand, said it is SBTC that monitors all activities of blood banks. “The information on number of people infected with HIV due to infected blood transfusion is not available with us. There is an option of recording the mode of transmission of HIV for clients being tested at ICTC. However, there are no means to verify this,” said Khushalsinh Pardeshi, project director, MSACS. The bickering between the agencies also highlights how none of them may be actively monitoring the number of HIV infections happening through the transfusion route.
, 
, According to MSACS data, annual new HIV infections in Maharashtra have reduced from 10,431 in 2007 to 5,893 in 2011 while there has been a 49% decline in AIDS related deaths.

,
, President of the NGO, Jagjit Singh Mann, while talking to ToI, said: “When it comes to keeping the identity of the HIV positive patient confidential, there are very minute things on which people need to focus, otherwise it can lead to discrimination against them in society.

If Dr Sooch knew that the identity of the HIV positive outreach worker was being discussed openly, then he should have been taken care to conceal it.

Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan also face a supply crisis, which, sources said, stemmed from bureaucratic delays in procurement. 
,
, Target intervention groups, which distribute condoms as part of public health programmes, have written to the , (SACS) and other bodies, urgently seeking supplies, sources said.
, 
, 
, 
,
, The matter was recently raised with the Union health ministry, following which the health secretary met senior officials from the , (NACO) on Thursday. 
,
, “The issue has been brought to my notice. We have a meeting again tomorrow where we will analyse the situation and take measures to address the problem,” health secretary Lov Verma told TOI. 
,
, Sources said the shortage is primarily caused by bureaucratic delays. “While HLL Lifecare is unable to keep up with the demand, negotiations with private players is a long drawn process,” a source said.
, 
, 
, 
,
, “Several target invention groups working in these states have written to us seeking supplies of condoms as there are shortages. We have reported the matter to the government in our recent meeting,” said Nochiketa Mohanty, country program manager at , Healthcare Foundation (AHF) India. AHF, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit organization, provides anti-retroviral medicines and advocacy in 36 countries. 
,
, The crisis is not limited to condoms. There is also a shortage of HIV testing kits as well as anti-retroviral medicines, mainly pediatric drugs, across the country, health activists working with HIV patients informed. 
,
, Medecins Sans Frontieres, another leading international group working with HIV/AIDS patients, confirmed the shortages of condoms as well as anti-retroviral drugs and testing kits across many states. 
,
, These shortages assume significance because India continues to battle against the infection. The UN estimates that India currently has the third largest population of HIV infected people in the world. 
,
, India’s AIDS control programme provides free treatment to more than one-third of the country’s 2.1 million HIV/AIDS patients and is the largest in the world. But, with such shortages, the country faces the risk of not only increased prevalence of the disease but also a rise in new infections, experts say.

"Feb 6, 2015, 04:58 IST",Smartphone dongle detects HIV in 15 mins,"WASHINGTON: Researchers have developed a low-cost smartphone dongle that can simultaneously detect HIV and syphilis from a finger prick of blood in just 15 minutes. 

, The device, developed by a team of researchers led by ,, associate %professor at Columbia University School of Engineering and Applied Science, can perform a point-of-care test that simultaneously detects three infectious disease markers. %The device replicates, for the first time, all %mechanical, optical and electronic functions of a lab-based blood test, researchers said. 
,
, The device performs an , (,) without requiring any stored energy: all necessary power is drawn from the smartphone. It performs a triplexed immunoassay not currently available in a single test format: HIV antibody, treponemal-specific antibody for syphilis, and non-treponemal antibody for active syphilis infection. 
,
, The accessory or dongle easily connects to a smartphone or computer and was recently piloted by health care workers in Rwanda who tested whole blood obtained via a finger prick from 96 patients who were enrolling into prevention-of-mother-to-child-transmission cli8nics or voluntary counselling and testing centers. ""Our work shows that a full laboratory-quality immunoassay can be run on a smartphone accessory,"" said Sia. 
,
, ""Coupling microfluidics with recent advances in consumer electronics can make %certain lab-based diagnostics accessible to %almost any population with access to sm-8%art8phones. This kind of capability can tr8ansform how health care services are de8livered around the world,"" he said. Sia's %team developed the dongle to be small and light enough to fit into one hand. and to run assays on disposable plastic cassettes with pre-loaded reagents, where disease-specific zones provided an objective read-out, much like an ELISA assay. 
,
, Sia estimates the dongle will have a manufacturing cost of USD 34, much lower than the USD 18,450 that typical ELISA equipment runs. 
,
, The team made two main innovations to the dongle to achieve low power consumption, a must in places that do not always have electricity. 
,
, The researchers eliminated the power-consuming electrical pump by using a ""one-push vacuum,"" where a user mechanically activates a negative-pressure chamber to move a sequence of reagents pre-stored on a cassette. 
,
, The process is durable, requires little user training, and needs no maintenance or additional manufacturing. 
,
, Sia's team removed the need for a battery by using the audio jack for transmitting power and for data transmission. And, because audio jacks are standardised among smartphones, the dongle can be attached to any compatible smart device in a plug-and-play manner. 
,
, The research is published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

This has left the eight-year-old boy distraught ever since he returned to , after meeting his 15-year-old sister in Surat recently. 

, The teenage girl is sheltered at Janani Dham, which is managed by GSNP+ (Gujarat State Network of People living with HIV+\Aids). The boy was among the 135 children, who had been brought to , at Kamrej, 15km from Surat, under the state children consultation programme in December 2014. After two days, the boy had to leave the centre as two HIV+ children of different genders even if they are siblings are not allowed together under The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act.

"Feb 16, 2015, 06:40 IST",New aggressive form of HIV accelerates AIDS,"LONDON: A new aggressive form of , can progress to , in just three years - so rapidly that patients may not even realize they were infected, scientists say. 

, Engaging in unprotected sex with multiple partners increases the risk of contracting multiple strains of HIV. Once inside a host, these strains can recombine into a new variant of the virus, researchers said. 
,
, One such recombinant variant observed in patients in Cuba appears to be much more aggressive than other known forms of HIV, researchers said. Before it can enter human cells, HIV must first anchor itself to them. The virus does this via anchor points, or co-receptors, which are proteins on the cell membrane. 
,
, In a normal infection, the virus first uses the anchor point CCR5. In many patients, after a number of healthy years, the virus then switches to the anchor point CXCR4. This co-receptor switch coincides with a faster progression to AIDS. 
,
, Researchers at KU Leuven's Laboratory for Clinical and Epidemiological Virology in Belgium have described a recombinant form of HIV observed in patients in Cuba that makes this transition much faster. The virus targets the anchor point CXCR4 early after infection, shortening drastically the healthy phase and triggering rapid progression to AIDS. 
,
, The transition from anchor point CCR5 to CXCR4 is normally very difficult. Researchers suspect that the rapid transition observed in this HIV recombinant occurs as a result of combining fragments from different HIV subtypes.

As TOI checked with some counsellors, who carry out these free tests, there is acute shortage of these kits as well as of gloves, syringes and vacuum tubes. Those from the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community and sex workers are fearful that, since no tests are being conducted, there can be a rise in HIV/AIDS cases among them. , 	Ravi, an NGO employee working with gay and bisexual men, says members of this community must go for the tests every six months. “The counsellor at Aruna Asaf Ali Hospital said there are no kits. When we went to Welcome Colony’s ICTC, it was the same. While we were waiting outside the counsellor’s room, two pregnant women got the tests done. When we confronted her, she said that only one kit was available and pregnant women are their priority,” he said. , 	At the Kashmere Gate ICTC, Mallika, a transgender, was twice denied the test for the same reason. Herself an activist, Mallika is worried as “convincing transgenders to take the tests is very difficult. Now, with no kits, the disease will only spread. When we asked the counsellors, they said there is shortage at the government level”. Some members of the community are convinced that the government has intentionally pulled the plug from the programme. “My partner and I are experiencing symptoms of HIV. We are both very anxious and now kits aren’t available. I think the government is looking for ways to finish off the community,” Kunal, who went to Hindu Rao Hospital for the test but had to return without it done, said. A counsellor working at Aruna Asaf Ali hospital in Civil Lines confirmed the shortage. “Even if a kit is available, we ask them to get gloves, syringes and vacuum tubes as there is acute shortage,” she said. Since there are no funds, even reports are sometimes given verbally. , 	The 92 NGOs associated with the government AIDS awareness programme haven’t been paid for the past seven months and many are now pulling out. Rupika, an NGO worker, is working without salary for eight months. “We want Delhi government to intervene immediately,” she said. The community is now planning to meet chief minister Arvind Kejriwal at one of his Janta Darbars. “If that doesn’t help, we will have to protest outside Delhi secretariat,” a transgender said. "

Researchers found that the new drug candidate blocks every strain of HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus) that has been isolated from humans or rhesus macaques, including the hardest-to-stop variants. It also protects against much-higher doses of virus than occur in most human transmission and does so for at least eight months after injection. 

, “Our compound is the broadest and most potent entry inhibitor described so far,” said Michael Farzan, from the Florida campus of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI). When HIV infects a cell, it targets the CD4 lymphocyte, an integral part of the body’s immune system. HIV fuses with the cell and inserts its own genetic material and transforms the host cell into a HIV manufacturing site. 
,
, The new study builds on previous discoveries by the Farzan laboratory, which show that a co-receptor called CCR5 contains unusual modifications in its critical HIV-binding region, and that proteins based on this region can be used to prevent infection. 
,
, Farzan and his team developed the new drug candidate so that it binds to two sites on the surface of the virus simultaneously, preventing entry of HIV into the host cell. 
,
, “When antibodies try to mimic the receptor, they touch a lot of other parts of the viral envelope that HIV can change with ease,” said TSRI Research Associate Matthew Gardner, the first author of the study with Lisa M Kattenhorn of Harvard Medical School. 
,
, The team also leveraged preexisting technology in designing a delivery vehicle - an engineered adeno-associated virus, a small, relatively innocuous virus that causes no disease. Once injected into muscle tissue, like HIV itself, the vehicle turns those cells into “factories” that could produce enough of the new protective protein to last for years, perhaps decades, Farzan said.

 While standard anti-TB drugs can cure most people of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, improper use of antibiotics has led to new strains of the bacterium resistant to the two most powerful medications, isoniazid and rifampicin. 
,

,
, Just like other living organisms, the genetic information contained in M tuberculosis undergoes a complex process known as transcription in which the bacterial enzyme, DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, or RNAP, produces TB RNA. This molecule is involved in processes that produce critical bacterial proteins that the organism needs to survive. 
,
, Nair and his colleagues said they were surprised to discover through preliminary experiments that the compound also exhibited strong anti-HIV properties, opening the door for dual therapeutic applications. The risk for developing TB is between 26 and 31 times greater in people living with HIV than those without HIV infection.

, The , (NMC) runs TB centre at , (IGGMC) since 2007. Now, under the Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) it will soon use the latest equipment and testing tool called CBNAAT (cartridge based nucleic acid amplification test). This is meant for HIV positive patients, who are extremely prone to get TB as a secondary infection due to the drastic fall in their immunity.

, Lakshmi is not the exception. A study conducted by the , (NIRT) in the city found that more than half the children (59%) living with HIV hail from families that do not have reliable access to sufficient quantity of affordable and nutritious food, leading to malnutrition. This is mainly because HIV hits the productive age groups the most, causing a dip in the family income and reduced food availability for the entire household.

, The result not only means that Valacyclovir can be used effectively with a broader range of HIV-1 patients, but also suggests promising new avenues for the development of HIV-fighting drugs.
, 
, 
,
, 
, This insight is particularly significant given that some forms of HIV-1 have become resistant to existing medications.

, 
, Rodriguez said studies by these groups helped illuminate exactly how the medication decreases HIV-1 levels.
, 
, 
, 
,
, 
, Valacyclovir is activated in virus-infected cells, and then blocks the ability of HIV to reproduce. HIV-1 can lead to the immune deficiency known as AIDS.
, 
, Scientists previously thought that Valacyclovir helped reduce HIV levels and worked by decreasing the immune activation caused by HSV-2.
, 
, With fewer immune cells to attack, the theory went, HIV-1 could not spread as widely.
, 
, After conducting laboratory studies with Acyclovir, an earlier sibling drug of Valacyclovir, Leonid Margolis, of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), saw that the medication clearly blocked HIV-1 reproduction, even when HSV-2 was absent.

A health department official said Elisa test is used to test the blood donated by a donor for blood safety. But, it has its own limitation. If a person is infected with HIV today, the test will not be able to detect HIV virus in the person for at least four weeks of being infected as it is the window period. It is a period when a person infected with HIV will test negative for HIV., , But, NAT is much more improved testing which blood banks should have for ensuring blood safety.

Also, high HIV prevalence among youth, pregnant women and adults remain a cause of concern. , 	In the third part of series on Millennium Development Goals (MDG) achieved by state, TOI analyses how Chhattisgarh and neighbouring MP fare on both parameters at national level. , 	, , 	Among major states, maternal mortality rate (MMR) (i.e. maternal deaths per one lakh live births), ranges from 61 in Kerala to 300 in Assam (highest) in 2011-13. MMR in BIMARU states of Bihar/Jharkhand (208), Madhya Pradesh/Chhattisgarh (221), Rajasthan (244), Uttar Pradesh/Uttarakhand (285) and Orissa (222) was reportedly much higher than all India level estimates (167). Four states UP, Bihar, MP/CG and Rajasthan together contributed to 67% of MMR in the country. , 	Chhattisgarh and MP were also going to miss MDG target for 2015 (150.7) by a huge margin of 40 points. , 	Maternal mortality rate (MM Rate), number of maternal deaths in age 15 to 49 per lakh of women was also among highest (20.2), only below UP and Rajasthan and almost double that of national average (11.7). , 	Life time risk or probability that, one women of reproductive age (15 to 49) will die due to child birth within six weeks after delivery was 0.7%, higher than average. , 	As per the sample registration system estimates of 2011-13, 68% of maternal deaths were women in the age group of 20 to 29 years. , 	Though Madhya Pradesh along with Andhra Pradesh is expected to achieve universal coverage of births by skilled health personnel up in 2015, the proportion has actually dipped in the state from 2009 where it was 56.4% and would be 50.5% in 2015. , 	, , 	There have been around 2,500 deaths because of HIV/AIDS in 2011 (last available date). This was lower than MP’s 3,324 while highest was Andhra Pradesh (31,347). , 	However, prevalence of HIV in youth, young pregnant women and adults was much higher than MP and more than national average in youth category while at par in the rest. Also Chhattisgarh reported double the number of new infections (4,565) than MP (2,387)in 15+ age group which is a cause for concern. This could be attributed due to the fact that condom use rate was lower in Chhattisgarh than MP (2.9 and 4.8 respectively). Both states were also lower on condom use rate among contraceptives use in India (5.2). While female sterilizations remain the preferred choice of contraceptives in both urban and rural pollution, it doesn’t protect against HIV incidence. , 	MP and Chhattisgarh reported more than two lakh malaria cases in 2014 out of the 10.7 lakh total cases in the country with over a lakh cases reported from the latter state. MP reported more deaths in 2013 but fewer deaths than Chhattisgarh in 2014. More than a 1,000 deaths were reported pan India in 2013 and 2014. , 	85% cases in 2014 in CG were caused by Plasmodium falciparum parasite, which is critical as it is prone to develop severity and death.

"Updated: Apr 4, 2015, 04:38 IST","Malnutrition behind 55% of TB cases in India, not HIV","NEW DELHI: The search for a tuberculosis vaccine has proved elusive despite decades of research. However, there is one vaccine that has been found to cut , disease incidence in India by half — food. 

, Chronic lack of adequate food is the reason for more than half of the TB infections here progressing to become a fullblown disease, says a study. 
,
, In an international publication 'Eradicating TB - Challenges, Perspectives, Solutions', of the Observer Research Foundation, experts from across the world and India stressed on the need for India's TB control programme to take into account the role of social conditions such as rising inequity, ,, poverty and over-crowding in the spread of TB. 
,
, Even though 40% of the Indian population or 480 million people carry the TB bug within their body, TB cases annually is estimated to be 2.3 million, a fraction of those who carry the infection. ""Over 90% of those carrying the TB bug are able to prevent the infection from becoming TB disease with the help of the body's immune system. Anything that reduces the strength of one's immunity, like lack of good nutritious food, increases the risk of contracting TB,"" explained Dr Anurag Bhargava of the Himalayan Institute of Medicine and an expert on TB treatment. 
,
, Instead of Direct Observed Treatment Short course (DOTS), a World Health Organisation (WHO) concept, Dr Bhargava felt that it might be more effective to have a programme more suited to Indian needs called DOST—Directly Observed and Supported Treatment – which would offer TB patients and their families nutritional support and counselling through behavorial change of healthcare providers along with treatment. 
,
, He added that several studies have shown that unlike many African countries, where HIV is the biggest risk factor for TB, in India, 55% of TB is attributable to under nutrition.
, 
, 
, 
,
, An annual estimated mortality of 2, 70,000 deaths means that TB claims one life in India every two minutes. According to R S Gupta, former deputy director general of the Central TB Division in India, malnutrition is one of the primary reasons for the high incidence of TB. ""TB patients suffers from loss of appetite, nutrient malabsorption, micronutrient malabsorption and altered metabolism, which leads to wasting. Deficiency in proteins and micronutrients increases the risk of TB. It has been found that malnourished TB patients have delayed recovery and higher mortality rates than well-nourished patients,"" said Gupta. 
,
, ""It cannot be stressed enough that without ensuring better nutrition and environmental conditions, mere medication, no matter how good and effectively administered, is unlikely to solve the problem,"" said Harsh Sethi of the Observer Research Foundation. He added that, an underfed citizenry forced to live in unsanitary surroundings is unlikely to respond favourably to medical care.

In 2013, 505 new cases were detected whereas in 2014 the number fell to 449., , Vandana Pathankar, project director, GSACS, said that on April 1 they completed 10 years of introduction of ART therapy in Goa. While initially there was only one ART centre located in Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital, Bambolim, which catered to over 1,000 patients, where free anti-retroviral drugs were made available, subsequently link ART plus centers were opened in the South Goa district hospital, Margao, sub-district hospital, Ponda and Cottage hospital, Chicalim., , A large number of HIV infections occurred through the perinatal route, and annual infections through this route were between 4 to 5%. The GSACS has adopted Prevention of Parent-to-child Transmission (PPTCT) strategy which is considered cost-effective method in controlling the virus via this route. This programme basically helps effective reduction of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection by providing quality antenatal care including preventive services., , Since introduction of this programme, HIV prevalence rate among antenatal mothers who accepted HIV test has decreased from 1.48 %, in 2003 to 0.18 in 2013., , GSACS’s annual bulletin has revealed that 89% of the spouses who opted for HIV test were tested positive, and HIV prevalence directly in labour has decreased from 2.46% in 2003 to 0% in 2013., , Also, prominent change noted by GSACS is that the proportion of direct walk-in persons undergoing HIV testing has registered a steep increase — this is also true of female patients., , Currently, GSACS also focuses on improving HIV/AIDs awareness, controlling sexually transmitted diseases (STD), including condom promotion, and ensuring availability of safe blood and blood products., , Another focus area of GSACS is ART. The ART, though it does not cure HIV, it slows down the virus from multiplying so fewer viruses attack the immune system once an HIV positive person starts the treatment, says a doctor at GSACS., , An HIV positive person on ART therapy can to a large extent lead a healthy life but subject to good adherence to the first line of ART. The GSACS now offers at GMC’s ART centre the second line of ART also which was not available in Goa earlier. HIV patients with a failure of first line of ART, were referred to J J Hospital, Mumbai., ,  "

, The study by National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis had about 282 patients getting macronutrient supplement at Tuberculosis Research Centre clinics in Chennai and Madurai for six months. It showed not just significant improvement in nutritional parameters, but also that the CD4 cell count of these patients remained stable, indicating their immunity was being maintained. The patients who took part in the study were were not on antiretroviral therapy (ART). 
,
, CD4 cells are a type of white blood cells that protect the body from infection. Once infected with HIV, the cells are attacked and destroyed by the virus. However, at the time of the study, the guideline recommended initiation of ART before CD4 cell counts decrease below 250 cells while the recent guidelines suggest 350 cells. 
,
, Malnutrition in HIV-positive adults is an issue that requires special attention as it leads to faster disease progression, high mortality rate and suboptimal response to anti-retroviral therapy. And if they are the bread winners, it could affect the whole family. 
,
, The nutritional parameters that were observed to have significantly increased among the group that received macronutrient supplement are body weight, body mass index, mid-arm circumference, fat-free mass, and body cell mass. The observation was compared with that of a control group of 79 patients who received only standard care. This group did not show any improvement, and their CD4 count dropped.

,
, NIRT director Dr Soumya Swaminathan said that though an increase in nutrition levels were observed, they may not be statistically significant. That was partly due to the study design and other biological and behaviourial factors.

,
, Vihan is taking care of 510 HIV infected children. Out of this, 280 cannot afford nutritious food. Following an earlier appeal, around 153 of these children were adopted by charity organizations and individuals. 
,
, “There is specific requirement of calories and other necessary intake when the child is on ,. Often, these children are depressed due to the stigma attached to HIV. They often fall ill as HIV attacks their immune system. In such conditions, nutritious food only can help them to survive,” Saul said. 
,
, “Some of these children live with their parents, while the orphans are being taken care of by other hostel facilities. “Every month we arrange a camp at Vihan and conduct medical check ups on them. We also invite the parents so that they could be aware of the condition of their child. During this camp, we distribute the children a month’s pack of medicine and nutritious food,” Saul added. 
,
, The NGO is looking for donors who could adopt responsibility of annual food packs of the children. Any individual can donate Rs 4,800 towards the cost of the annual pack to save at least one child’s life, the NGO said.

"Updated: May 5, 2015, 13:35 IST",AU scientist turns weed into HIV-I fighting agent,"ALLAHABAD: Obnoxious weed parthenium or Congress grass, which causes contact dermatitis in livestock and is reported to be poisonous for sheep and humans, has been transformed into a boon capable of fighting HIV-I by a young scientist of ,, Vyom Parashar. 

, Vyom claims to have developed a method to transform the extract of this weed into silver nanoparticle which, apart from having various medical uses, holds the promise to kill different microbe’s effectively. The work is being carried forward by the scientists at the Indian Grassland and Fodder Research Institute (,), Jhansi. 
,
, Vyom, who is doing research under Prof Avinash C Pandey of Allahabad University, has converted the leaf of Congress grass into silver nanoparticle and this research in bactericidal nanomaterials has opened a new era for pharmaceutical industry. “Silver nanoparticles are the metal of choice as they hold the promise to kill microbe’s effectively as these microbes generally have a harder time developing resistance to silver than they do to antibiotics,” said Vyom. 
,
, This useful finding, which has been published in Digest Journal of Nanomaterials and Biostructure, has been cited in as many as 14 researches worldwide. 
,
, Explaining the finding, Prof Pandey, who is also the Vice-Chancellor of Bundelkhand University, Jhansi, said “The methodology of converting the leaf of this weed is simple wherein its extract is added to a solution of silver nitrate in laboratory and within minutes the entire solution turns into silver nanoparticles.” Since, the method used for synthesis of these nanoparticles does not use any added chemicals, it is cost-effective and environmental friendly and has turned the tables for this weed, considered as a menace. 
,
, “These findings regarding Congress grass would make farmers build fortune as the cost of synthesising one liter of silver nanoparticle is just around Rs 30, whereas the end product can fetch Rs 3.5 lakh in the international market,” said Prof Pandey. 
,
, The finding is being pursued by the scientists at IGFRI Jhansi. “The finding by Prof Pandey’s team will come handy in meeting the menace of the weed which is troubling farmers,” said director IGFRI, Prof P K Ghosh. As our country has 20% of world cattle population which has to be fed on 2% of world’s land, research such as this will go miles to meet the problem of fodder for cattle also, he added.

Bhatt has however decided to combat the deadly retrovirus with his positive attitude.
 
, Looking to start life anew, Bhatt first decided to beat baldness. After having a fresh new head of healthy hair following a hair transplant, Bhatt says he has not only improved his appearance but has also gained enough courage to defy any odds.
, 
, After being denied a hair transplant by several hospitals, Bhatt approached Dr , at a multispecialty hospital in Thaltej Tekra. ""Bhatt was suffering from total hair loss up to mid scalp. Due to the virus, several ethical questions cropped up in our minds. Since the procedure involved multiple punctures, we were worried about our safety too,"" said Dr Thangavel.
, 
, ""We put together a fresh set of equipment, including hand piece, drill and sharing machines, which we had to discard after the surgery,"" Dr Thangavel said.
, 
, Speaking to TOI, a beaming Bhatt said: ""I'm married for two years now and generally married men don't opt for such procedures. But, it's a confidence thing at the end of the day. You feel confident with a full head of hair. Even when you are at down, I don't see why not to get it done.""
, 
, On the procedure, Dr Thangavel explained: ""We injected the scalp with an anesthetic to numb the area. We used the latest follicular unit extraction method to harvest follicles. Three or four units were used behind the hairline to give a natural density and direction. Then the recipient (bald) area was prepared by creating small slits with a scalpel with a slant towards the natural hair direction and each follicle was delicately slipped into the prepared slits, giving a near-natural appearance.""

"Updated: May 10, 2015, 02:35 IST",Footloose & fancy-free: Travails of an HIV+ child’s mother,"It’s , today. And what does a poor, sick mother, desperately trying to ensure that her HIV positive orphaned child gets his essential daily dose of life-saving medicines get? Insensitivity, buck-passing and indolence by the government medical fraternity and the , officials!
 
, On Thursday, incidentally observed as AIDS Orphans Day (part of the annual global Aids awareness week), a desperate 25-year-old widow in , was running from pillar to post in a frantic bid to obtain the next dose of ART for her eight-year-old son. An HIV positive person needs to take the prescribed medicine daily, just like a daily insulin dose for diabetics. If the dose is missed, even for a day, the immune system of the patient starts deteriorating. The people at the ART dispensing centre were helpless, stocks were over (The special ART formulation for children is given in a syrup form). When the woman, in desperation, went to submit a written intimation to the nodal medical officer, pleading that the medicine be made available, she was brushed aside. He refused to accept her application.
, 
, The woman, a widow, who somehow ekes out a living working in a private school, is distraught. For the past five days, she has abandoned her work, running to and fro the dispensing centre. The irony is that the medication can only be obtained from the government centre and no private chemist shop in Chhapra stocks the medicine, which is very expensive.
, 
, “I went to get the medicines on the May 4, a day before the last dose ran out (This is the practice. Patients are given medicines for a month only, and they can’t ask for any advance stock). There was no medicine available. My child is on ART since 2011. What’s worrying me is that in January, when a CD-4 count was done, his platelet count had dropped to 311 from 1100. I’m desperate,” she said over the phone.
, 
, Exactly 14 days ago, I happened to visit the Chhapra ART centre with , Sanjeet Singh, where the persons concerned told us that stocks were low. “We are just not receiving adequate stocks from BSACS, and we struggle to do what we can,” they said.
, 
, “The high court has decreed that every ART centre should have a two-month stock of ART medicines and medicines for opportunistic infections, but despite assurances from BSACS officials, see the situation!” says Sanjeet.
, 
, In Chhapra, the situation is overwhelming. Last month 1748 patients received ART. There are about 150 children on ART. NACO guidelines are not met. BSACS has not appointed the required staff. No medical officer, so obviously, no ‘accountable’ official! Pregnant women have to buy their own ‘safe delivery kits’ from private stores in Patna because the hospital has no stock. HIV positive pregnant women are denied surgery at Chhapra. The official line is, “So far, no such case has been brought to our notice.” There is no CD4 testing machine, even though NACO funds were there for one unit in each district, it is said. The woman says, “My child is the only reason I am living, if he dies, I am nothing, I might as well destroy myself.” Just as I write the finishing line to this article, Saturday 8am, I receive a phone call. The ART medicines have finally arrived, and will be given out today. Happy Mother’s Day!

The baby, born in prison on January 22, was handed over to the Salem-based Lifeline Trust adoption agency on May 11 after his mother expressed her unwillingness to bring up yet another child in prison. 

, “We have completed all procedures following the her willingness to surrender her baby. The baby will be in Lifeline Trust until he is put up for adoption. Meanwhile, if the mother changes her mind, she can seek to get back her child within 60 days,” district social welfare officer (DSWO) S Usha told TOI. 
,

Police said she resorted to the extreme step following a fight with her first husband Selvaraj, who passed away a few years ago. After the high court upheld the lower court’s conviction of life term, the woman was lodged in prison in March 2014. Meanwhile, she had married again.

,. 

, , has a voracious sweet tooth, which turns out to be its Achilles' heel, according to researchers from Northwestern Medicine and Vanderbilt University. 
,
, After the virus invades an activated immune cell, it craves sugar and nutrients from the cell to replicate and fuel its wild growth throughout the body. 
, 
, 
, 
,
, Scientists discovered the switch that turns on the immune cell's abundant sugar and nutrient pipeline. 
,
, Then they blocked the switch with an experimental compound, shutting down the pipeline and, thereby, starving HIV to death. The virus was unable to replicate in human cells in vitro. 
,
, The discovery may have applications in treating cancer, which also has an immense appetite for sugar and other nutrients in the cell, which it needs to grow and spread. 
,
, ""This compound can be the precursor for something that can be used in the future as part of a cocktail to treat HIV that improves on the effective medicines we have today,"" said Harry Taylor, assistant professor in Medicine-Infectious Diseases. 
, 
, 
, 
,
, HIV needs to grow in a type of immune cell (CD4+ T-cell) that is active, meaning it is already responding to pathogens in the blood. 
,
, Activation increases the T-cell's supplies of sugar and other critical nutrients needed for both cell and virus growth. 
,
, Until now, no one knew the first step that signalled a newly activated T-cell to stock up on sugar and other nutrients. Those nutrients become the building blocks of genetic material the cell and the virus need to grow. 
,
, Northwestern and Vanderbilt scientists figured out that the first step in stocking the T-cell's pantry involved turning on a cell component called phospholipase D1 (PLD1). Then they used an experimental compound to block PLD1 and shut down the pipeline. 
,
, This is believed to be the first time scientists have targeted the virus's ability to pilfer the cell's pantry to stop its growth. 
, 
, 
, 
,
, The compound also slowed the proliferation of the abnormally activated immune cells, the study found. 
,
, Current HIV medications stop HIV growth but do not affect the abnormal excess activation and growth of immune cells triggered by HIV. 
,
, The excess immune cell growth is believed to contribute to the life-long persistence of HIV and leads to excess inflammation that causes premature organ damage in HIV patients - even when the virus is suppressed by current medicines. 
,
, ""Perhaps this new approach, which slows the growth of the immune cells, could reduce the dangerous inflammation and thwart the life-long persistence of HIV,"" Taylor added. The study was published in the journal PLOS Pathogens.

Blood donors and doctors in the city say that most of the blood banks do not comply with testing norms while collecting blood.
 
, “Whenever blood is collected, the banks must conduct a test ­ called the Elisa test to check for HIV-AIDS virus. But, most banks do not do so,“ said Ghanshyam Ojha, a member of Team India, a leading NGO working in the field.
, 
, Ojha explained that the Elisa test results become clear only after 36 hours. But, due to scarcity of blood and high demand, the blood is used even before its test results are obtained.
, 
, As per records with the State Aids Control Society (SACS), there are 2 lakh people who have tested positive for HIV in Telangana. Despite this startling figure, lack of enforcement of rules in blood banks is raising alarm among doctors. In fact, the society does not even have a record of those banks which do not comply with safety norms.
, 
, “Every blood bank must be checked to see if they are following the proper protocol. It is during times of crisis, usually dur ing epidemics such as dengue, that blood units are pushed out before they are checked,“ said a senior SACS official, adding that it is a crime to send out blood without testing it.
, 
, ""The government has made drug enforcement teams responsible for the checks. But in a city as large as Hyderabad, these teams are grossly understaffed,"" the official added.
, 
, Dr Ram Mohan, joint director, blood safety, SACS added: “Usually, testing kits are provided at nominal rates. But there are many blood banks which do not follow testing protocol. It is the state blood transfusion council's prerogative to ensure that bad blood does not reach the public.“
, 
, 
,
, 
, The government should immediately intervene and ensure that all blood units are properly checked before transfusion. There have been too many cases of contracting HIV through blood transfusion across the country. There should be more staff and the latest equipment available to speed up testing in blood banks.

"Updated: Jun 20, 2015, 06:34 IST,(Thinkstock photos/Getty Images)",This vaccine could help block HIV,"WASHINGTON: Scientists have designed a new experimental HIV , that may stimulate the immune system to block infection from the deadly virus. 

, New research led by scientists at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI), International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) and the Rockefeller University shows in mice that the vaccine candidate can stimulate the immune system activity necessary to stop , infection. The findings could provide key information for the development of an effective AIDS vaccine, researchers said. 
,
, The research, published in the journals Cell and Science, represents a leap forward in the effort to develop a vaccine against HIV, which has so far struggled to elicit antibodies (immune system molecules) that can effectively fight off different strains of the virus. “The results are pretty spectacular,” said Dennis Burton, chairman of the TSRI department of immunology and microbial science. 
,
, While many vaccines for other diseases use a dead or inactive version of the disease-causing microbe itself to trigger antibody production, immunisations with “native” HIV proteins are ineffective in triggering an effective immune response, due to HIV’s ability to evade detection from the immune system and mutate rapidly into new strains. 
,
, This challenge has led researchers to believe that a successful AIDS vaccine will need a series of related, but slightly different proteins (immunogens) to train the body to produce broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV- a twist on the traditional “booster” shot, where a person is exposed to the same immunogen multiple times. 
,
, The scientists tested one of these potential proteins, an immunogen called eOD-GT8 60mer, using a technique called B cell sorting. The researchers showed that immunisation with eOD-GT8 60mer produced antibody “precursors” — with some of the traits necessary to recognize and block HIV infection. This suggested that eOD-GT8 60mer could be a good candidate to serve as the first in a series of immunisations against HIV, researchers said. 
,
, “The vaccine appears to work well in our mouse model to ‘prime’ the antibody response,” said TSRI professor David Nemazee.

Experts are calling this 'worrisome' because both regions were seen as low prevalence places compared to other parts of the country. , NACO officials believe the jump may be because of an increase in the number of injecting drug users (IDUs), however, there is no data available on such drug users., , These numbers have come to light when the Union home minister Rajnath Singh, on his visit to Anandpur Sahib last week, had asked the youth in Punjab to shun drugs. His statement upset the ruling Akali Dal which has said that Punjab is being defamed for fighting the drug menace., , NACO's observations have been seconded by another report of the parliamentary standing committee on health and family welfare submitted to the Rajya Sabha in April. It names Assam, Delhi, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Punjab and Uttarakhand as states which have shown a rise in adult HIV prevalence. It also points at reduced funding to NACO which may have shrunk its role in these regions., , Dr B B Rewari, national programme officer (antiretroviral therapy), NACO, said, ""The rise is in the last five years. Punjab has more IDUs than the north-eastern states and that is main risk factor for HIV infections."", , In fact, Chandigarh, which is often seen as insulated from Punjab's drug problem because of its Union Territory status, has started showing some of the symptoms. A study, 'High risk behaviours of injecting drug users (IDUs) in Chandigarh' says that 48.9% of IDUs shared needles. The study was conducted by A Das Mohapatra, Manmeet Kaur, Rajesh Kumar and P V M Lakshmi of Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research., , The prevalence of needle sharing has been reported by various national studies to be 30.3% and 41.9% among IDUs in Haryana and Punjab. ""Chandigarh is not far from Punjab which has a high number of IDUs. So, we are not surprised by the results,"" says Kumar., "

Admitted to , in the city on June 19 for a caesarean delivery, doctors not only pasted a big piece of paper on her bed that screamed ‘Bio Hazard +ve’, complete with the red AIDS ribbon drawn on it to announce that here was one battling the deadly virus, she was also made to clean her own medical waste after the stitches were cut three days later. 

, Not stopping at that, a senior doctor also allegedly abused Meena for “bringing another diseased child into the world”. Because of the handwritten pamphlet, all her relatives and friends who visited her at the hospital have now come to know of her , status, adding to the woman's extreme anxiety.
, 
, 
, 
,
, When news about the ill-treatment of Meena reached the Care Support Centre (CSC) that fights for the rights of people living with HIV (PLHIVs), members of its district responsible team (DRT), Ritu Saxena and Vinita Devi, went to the hospital where they found the piece of paper still stuck to her bedside. 
,
, “We immediately tore it off and took the authorities to task. Fearing that the issue might become too big to handle, the hospital staff rushed to control the damage,” Saxena told TOI on Thursday. 
,
, Hospital authorities confirmed the “unfortunate” incident and said they have apologized to the patient. “I understand this should not have happened but the doctors have given a written apology and the patient has made peace with the staff,” said Abhilasha Gupta, head of the obstetrics and gynaecology department at the hospital.

They termed her a ‘dreaded disease’,” she wept.

"Updated: Jun 26, 2015, 01:20 IST,The sacking of peer educators and outreach workers will directly impact the distribution of condoms, lubricant... ","No funds, no condoms, 3L in Maharashtra at HIV risk","MUMBAI: A practically broke , State , Control Society (,) has asked NGOs to curtail their , prevention activities in the state and do away with a significant chunk of their workforce. Over 182 projects that cater to nearly three lakh high-risk population in the state will suffer as distribution of condoms and syringes to availability of medicines and testing kits will take a direct hit. 

, The circular issued on June 11 has asked NGOs and community-based organizations (CBOs) to curtail the strength of their peer educators by 80% and outreach workers by 25%. A majority of these agencies have not received a dime from the state body since January this year, and therefore have been grappling with massive attrition due to non-payment of salaries. 
,
, The sacking of peer educators and outreach workers will directly impact the distribution of condoms, lubricants and syringes in the state’s most vulnerable pockets. Peer educators are members or leaders who belong to the high-risk community (female sex workers, transgenders and men having sex with men) and carry out the crucial task of distributing condoms and motivating people to get tested. 
,
, The MSACS in its circular blamed the change in funding pattern of the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) for the delay in receiving funds, which are likely to arrive only by October this year. However, TOI has learned that , had released around Rs 8 crore as a contingency measure, which has been lying with the state treasury for the past two months. Project director Khushalsinh Pardeshi could not be reached for comment. 
,
, MSACS that presented an annual budget of Rs 130.12 crore had received only three-fourths of the money. The annual plan for 2015-2016 of nearly Rs 200 crore is yet to be approved by NACO, which has committed only 80% or less. 
,
, Maharashtra till date remains one of the six high-risk states in the country with a prevalence rate of 0.40%. According to NACO’s annual report, over 40,000 people had tested positive for HIV in 2013-2014 out of the 20 lakh who were tested, indicating that the HIV scare is still very pertinent. 
,
, The fund crunch, said to be one of the worst for the state body, has already started affecting people living with HIV. The stock of anti-retroviral medicines that keep nearly 1.80lakh adults and 11,000 children alive is erratic. While NACO provides the ART drugs, MSACS would often financially support NGOS to locally purchase drugs if the drugs did not come on time. “CBOs like us are struggling for existence. Who do you think will worry about some patients not getting medicines on time or progressing to the second line?” asked a Pune-based agency that is thinking of giving up three of its projects. 
,
, The crisis has also reached the state body’s doorstep. Sources told TOI that the last lot of condoms has already been distributed to NGOs, while consumables required to draw blood and carry out HIV tests are long over at MSACS. Worse, the state body has run out of paper to print HIV test reports at several of its Integrated Centres for Counselling and Testing (ICTC). 
,
, “It is appalling how a national programme used the services of female sex workers and transgenders and now wants to get rid of them. Many of them have left prostitution to work fully for the programme. What are we going to tell them?” questioned Meena Seeshu, who runs three projects at Sangli. As per the state diktat, 40 of her peer educators stand to lose employment. “We suspect the rate of new infections is already going up,” said a Pune-based NGO’s director. Following the circular, at least two NGOs have communicated to MSACS that they will be withdrawing their projects with female sex workers and migrants. 
,
, When TOI contacted NACO, a senior official from the finance department said that it is time the state bore some burden of the HIV programme. “We have formed a committee that will negotiate with state governments. We will still be paying most of the money,” the official said. The country’s HIV programme has taken a beating since multilateral organizations, including WHO and several UN agencies such as UNICEF and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), have drastically reduced or diverted funds since 2013.

"Updated: Jul 2, 2015, 10:51 IST,HIV-1 virus infects and destroys key immune cells, known as CD4 T cells, that would ordinarily mount a defense against the virus",Scientists find potential new HIV therapy,"NEW YORK: , have discovered a way to block replication of the most common form of , at a key moment when the , is just starting to develop. 

, Transmitted through bodily ,, the HIV-1 virus infects and destroys key immune cells, known as CD4 T cells, that would ordinarily mount a defense against the virus and initiate the antiviral activity of other immune cells. 
,
, Scientists have long known that a substance produced by CD4 T cells called Interleukin-21 (IL-21) plays an important role in the immune system by activating immune cells that specialise in killing viruses like HIV-1 and driving the production of antibodies that attack them. 
,
, However, it was unclear how IL-21 might affect the early stages of HIV-1 infection that allows the virus to grow and spread unabated soon after a person is exposed. 
,
, Researchers from Weill Cornell Medical College, the Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University conducted two studies to uncover this effect. 
,
, The researchers created a culture from human tissues, primarily spleen and lymph node tissue. After exposing the cells to IL-21, they introduced HIV-1 and found that after 72 hours, cultures with IL-21 contained more than two-thirds less virus than those that didn't receive the treatment. 
,
, The second model tested IL-21 in mice transplanted with human stem cells to create a physiological environment as close as possible to that in people. 
,
, Over the course of two weeks, the mice began producing IL-21. After 14 days, more than half of the mice with IL-21 did not display a detectable level of HIV-1. 
,
, An analysis of the results suggested that IL-21 not only jump starts the immune system but also stops the HIV-1 virus from replicating during a critical, early window of its development, when it is concentrated in one location and has not yet started to spread throughout the body. 
,
, ""This study highlights components of the human immune system that are capable of mounting an antiviral response and driving intrinsic resistance to HIV-1,"" said senior author Dr Laurie H Glimcher, of Weill Cornell Medical College. 
,
, ""We are hopeful that this knowledge will help bring us one step closer to shielding patients from this deadly and complex virus,"" Glimcher said. 
,
, The reduction in viral load is due to the cascade of events initiated by IL-21. 
,
, The investigators found that IL-21 instructs CD4 T cells to increase the amount of a small RNA molecule. That molecule, microRNA-29 (miR-29), inhibits the replication of HIV-1, limiting the amount of virus produced from infected cells. 
,
, ""Our study has uncovered a potentially potent arsenal that patients have against the virus. We think IL-21 is one of those arsenals and that deploying it early will be very powerful in fighting the infection,"" said lead author Dr Stanley Adoro, a postdoctoral associate in medicine in Glimcher's lab. 
,
, The study was published in the journal Nature Communications.

, The woman (identity withheld), who delivered the child on July 2, was shocked to find the notice put up by her bedside and the cradle for the baby in a ward (No. 4), which had 24 other women. The humiliation of the couple did not end with the just the notice, as the staff kept addressing the women as “HIV walli” instead of her name. 
,
, Recounting what he termed as “humiliating days”, the husband said while the staff in the ward addressed all the women with their first names, my wife was called “HIV walli”. He said his requests to the staff to refrain from doing so made no difference and they were made to feel “outcastes” in the ward. 
,
, Though at present there are no comprehensive laws in India to deal with the menace of discrimination with HIV/AIDS infected people and their rights, India is signatory to various international treaties and agreements that provide for protection and non-discrimination with those suffering from the disease. 
,
, In fact two legislations, the HIV/AIDS Bill 2007 and Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (Prevention and Control) Bill, 2014, which provide for non-discrimination with those suffering from the disease, are pending clearance in the Parliament. 
,
, Dubbing the act of the BR Ambedkar hospital staff as “illegal”, experts point out that a HIV positive person has the right to keep his/her HIV/AIDS status confidential. They say that even Courts have upheld that that in case HIV patients do not want to disclose their identity, they can use a pseudonym before even the Courts to suppress their identity. A leading lawyer pointed out that the Bombay High court had ruled that the court would permit HIV positive litigant to suppress his or her identity and prosecute or defend the proceedings under an assumed name.

Admitting that it could be in the interest of the staff to know that an individual is an HIV patient, Rinki said the status of the individual could be mentioned on their health sheets and the prescriptions rather than publically declaring her status by putting put a poster and addressing her as “HIV walli”. 
,
, Rinki said moreover, the infant has yet not be tested for the disease as the same could be conducted only after two months and the subsequent process for confirming the actual status of HIV could take up to 18 months. “The hospital staff has already branded the child HIV positive by the poster on the side of the cradle”, she said. 
,
, Advocacy officer of Hindustan Latex Family Planning Promotion trust, ,, who also visited the hospital, said the staff cannot disclose the identity of an HIV patient and it had violated the NACO guidelines by doing so. 
,
, When contacted, hospital’s public relation officer, Shubhra, said the staff put up the “universal precaution” notice to make duty nurses aware of the patient’s status. She however, admitted that it was wrong to address the patient by her HIV status and the administration would look into it.

Trouble started brewing at NACO since 2013, when several international agencies started diverting funds from HIV to other diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria and dengue. The NACO, now completely dependent on the central government funds, has been facing financial constraint itself. The crisis became more pronounced with the Centre slashing health budget by 17% last year. , 	Sawant explained that NACO may be looking at 75:25 funding model, which currently exists for other national programmes such as the National Rural Health Mission. “NACO is expecting us to bear 25% of the programme cost. We have told the Centre that the state is already grappling with fund crunch. So, they should grant funds till we can allocate something from the state kitty,” Sawant added. MSACS has a budget of nearly Rs 150 crore that is used to sustain 142 of the 182 targeted intervention projects in the state. “The state programme caters to over eight lakh people, including female sex workers,” said an NGO from Pune that has not received any funds since January. , 	According to the MSACS circular, NGOs have to do away with 80% of the sanctioned strength of peer educators and 25% of outreach workers. On onwe hand, project director of MSACS Khushalsinh Pardeshi has assured that the core prevention activities will not suffer, but on the other hand, he admitted that NACO is behind its schedule of approving the 2015-16 plan for HIV prevention. “NACO has asked state governments to contribute at least 50% of the cost,” he said. , 	Stuck in this confusion are community-based organizations, such as Malwani-based Sakhi Char Chowghi Trust that works towards prevention of HIV among transgender and fear closure now as they are completely dependent on MSACS’s funds. MSACS, meanwhile, is desperately hoping that the state will expedite and release an amount of Rs 11.89 crore sanctioned by NACO, but waiting for cabinet approval. Till then, over 3000 people, many of who are HIV positive, fear loss of livelihood from July. "

, 
, ""Prevention of parent to child transmission of HIV virus is an essential part of AIDS control programme. While such testing is often available and conducted in a good hospital setting, it is not the same in rural areas and distant villages.

, 
, According to the source, mid-wives will be trained by state and district AIDS control organizations to conduct rapid tests to check HIV virus. Rapid tests are cold blood tests done through finger pricking. Mid-wives will be allowed to do the tests anytime during the pregnancy prior to delivery.
, 
, The health ministry is likely to issue the notification by end of this month allowing midwives to do such tests. ""At a later stage, the government may even consider allowing ayurvedacharyas or AYUSH doctors to carry on these tests,"" the source said.

The hospital and the two doctors have, however, denied any wrongdoing and said they would appeal against the verdict. , 	The lawyer, Subhash Mohanrao Pachlore, of Harsul in Aurangabad, was admitted to the hospital by his wife and relatives on July 11, 2007. He had a history of headaches, giddiness and loss of consciousness. A physician at the hospital, M A Majid, sent Pachlore’s blood sample to a pathology laboratory for the HIV test. , 	Pachlore told the forum that when he was being discharged from hospital three days later, the physician told his wife in the presence of relatives about the laboratory report indicating the HIV-positive status. He said the hospital discharge card also mentioned the HIV positivity. , 	Pachlore took the HIV test again at another pathology laboratory on July 14 but the findings were negative. In 2009, he filed a complaint with district forum against the hospital and the medical practitioners at the hospital and the first laboratory. , 	The forum headed by K N Tungar and comprising of members Sandhya Barlinge and Kiran R Thole observed, “The respondents were negligent in rendering their service to the complainant. They have acted negligently by disclosing a false positive report to the complainant, his wife and their relatives. They are guilty of causing mental and psychological agony to the wife of the complainant. , 	The complainant and his wife must have experienced huge affliction during such a long period and lost their peace of mind.” , 	Physician Majid told TOI that Pachlore had been hospitalised for cortical venous sinus thrombosis. He claimed that after the first HIV test was reactive, it was repeated the same day. “The second finding was negative. Pachlore’s wife was counselled and informed as he was drowsy and irritable. He was discharged after three days,” he said. , 	Majid said Pachlore had faith in the hospital as he got re-admitted for fever three days later. “He has suppressed this fact. Due to poor legal representation, the district forum imposed a fine on us in 2010. We appealed in the state forum and the fine was reduced to Rs 5 lakh. We challenged it in the national forum, which quashed both the orders and sent the matter back to the district forum saying that no proper opportunity was given to the respondents and that no medical expert evidence was taken by the lower courts,” he said. , 	Majid said they had got their deposit with interest on the order of the national forum. “The complainant went to Supreme Court for a stay on the judgment of the national forum, which was dismissed in 2011. However, the district forum did not consider the medical expert evidence and has passed this judgment against us. There was no negligence on our part. We are shocked by this judgment and will appeal in the state forum again,” he added. , "
"Updated: Jul 25, 2015, 06:04 IST",NACO guidelines help state see drop in birth of HIV positive babies,"PANAJI: Since 2014, 22 babies born to HIV positive mothers at Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, have tested negative. This is in contrast to previous years when the hospital used to get three to four cases of babies born infected with the deadly disease, yearly. This, doctors say, proves the results of prevention of parent to child transmission are finally showing. , Prevention of parent to child transmission was introduced in Goa after a significant number of new HIV cases were found to be occurring through the perinatal route— transmission of an illness from mother to child. A change was seen after new guidelines were rolled out by the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) in January 2014., , Dr Wanda Viegas, senior medical officer at the antiretroviral therapy (ART) centre at GMC, said that a significant change was seen after they started implementing the new guidelines. Now, a pregnant woman who’s HIV positive is immediately put on ART as opposed to the earlier method of starting treatment in the delivery room after pregnancy. Then, the mother was given a single dose of Nevirapine tablet and the baby a single dose of syrup., , ART is a combination of drugs given to HIV-infected persons with CD4 count less than 350. The CD4 count is an indicator of one’s immune system, and a falling CD4 count means a person infected with HIV is exposed to opportunistic infections. Normally, ART treatment for HIV patients is started only after his/her clinical investigation is conducted but Viegas said that in the case of pregnant mothers, they do not wait until the investigation is completed., , “The HIV carrier who’s pregnant is immediately put on ART while an investigation is conducted subsequently,” she added. Since April, three pregnant women have been put on the medication., , Currently, 280 children are registered with the ART centre, of which 184 children are undergoing ART. “Some of the children going through ART have now attained 18-20 years of age and are doing well,” she said., , Doctors say that it is sad as some HIV positive children who have lost one or both parents, are entirely dependant on other members of the family who in most cases, do not care enough. A doctor says, “We have a case of a boy who lost both his parents to AIDS. His visits to the ART center are irregular as his uncle does not give him money to travel.”, , Some children, mostly above 10 years of age, come to the centre alone to collect their monthly dose of medicines in the absence of a family member to escort them. An HIV positive person taking ART can lead a healthy life provided he/she sticks to a healthy lifestyle and adheres completely to the therapy., ,  "

","Suniti Solomon, who woke India up to HIV threat, dies at 76","CHENNAI: On July 22, 1987, 33-year-old S Noori sat in a dimly-lit corridor as a lanky woman in a lab coat strode towards her with a medical report. Noori was told she had tested positive for HIV, a then little known virus that was viciously attacking people around her. “She said I didn’t have much time to live as they had only recently discovered the disease and there was no cure. I was asked to make my life count,” said Noori, a transgender who gave up commercial sex work to help people from her community. 

, The woman who delivered the report to Noori was Dr ,, whose pioneering work in HIV a year earlier had startled the medical fraternity and pushed the government to act. In 1986, Dr Solomon, then a microbiologist at Madras Medical College, and her team for the first time documented evidence of HIV infection in India. Noori was among the second batch of around 135 commercial sex workers from Chennai who were tested. “She didn’t just break down science for us. She taught us to live,” said Noori. 
,
, For close to three decades Dr Solomon used science to save and make lives, and lost hers to cancer. She passed away at her residence in Chennai on Tuesday morning. She was 76, and is survived by her son Dr Sunil Solomon. 
,
, “We lost a prolific scientist, a great teacher and a wonderful person who worked tirelessly to bring science to the people,” said Dr Sundar Sundararaman, her student and later her colleague. Born into the illustrious Gaitonde family, Dr Solomon graduated from Madras Medical College. She married eminent cardio-thoracic surgeon Dr Solomon Victor. While Dr Solomon Victor focused on treating poor patients and in 1989 conceived the Rheumatic Heart Ailment project, Dr Suniti Solomon moved beyond research to set up Y R Gaitonde Centre for , Research and Education (YRG CARE), a premier HIV/AIDS care and support centre, in Chennai. 
,
, “More than the virus itself, Dr Solomon was concerned about the stigma HIV positive people faced,” said Dr D Dhanikachalam, head of technical support unit, Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TANSACS). “When the epidemic was first discovered, people were afraid to go close to those with HIV. She felt the pain they went through and worked to fight not just the virus but the discrimination too,” he said. 
,
, Trained in pathology in the UK and the US, her experience covered a range of aspects linked to HIV infection, biomedical parameters to socio-economics. She also published papers extensively on HIV epidemiology, prevention, care, support and related gender issues. In 2012, Dr Suniti Solomon was given the Lifetime Achievement Award for Service on HIV/AIDS by the state-run Dr MGR Medical University here. 
,
, In 2009, the ministry of science and technology conferred the ‘National Women Bio-scientist Award’ on her. In 2001, she was given a similar award for her pioneering work on HIV/AIDS by the state run-medical varsity. A fellow of National Academy of Medical Sciences (NAMS), New Delhi, she had served on several boards, including National Technical Team on Women and AIDS, Advisory Board of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative-India, the Scientific Committee of the National AIDS Research Institute Pune and the Microbicide Committee of Indian Council of Medical Research.

,
, In an earlier interaction with TOI, Dr Solomon had commended the work Tamil Nadu had done in the field of HIV/AIDS and said the state had come a long way in screening, but the programmes had become complacent with counselling. “We have contained the infection to an extent among truckers and female sex workers. But if we become complacent there will be an increase of incidence among these as well,” she had said. 
,
, People who worked with her are not surprised by her prediction. “She worked tirelessly for the cause not just inside labs but outside as well. If she was concerned, there were obvious reasons,” said a microbiologist, who worked closely with her in the late 90’s. Dr Solomon also said it was unfortunate that despite 30 years of the , and the progress made, there is still no cure or effective vaccine for the infection. “But what is killing people with AIDS more is the stigma and discrimination,” she had said.

It is expected to reach over 11crore people across rural and urban India., , Naik said that the government has an aggressive intervention programme to combat HIV/AIDS. The unique feature of the anti-HIV programme is that it has always kept the marginalized and high-risk groups as the focus areas. Over 15,000 integrated counselling and testing centres are now functional across the country. Over 410 anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centres provide treatment to about 7.4 lakh HIV patients in India., , Naik said that since Goa is a popular tourist destination, it needs a robust strategy. This is an important occasion to reiterate that our prevention service reaches every person., , Parsekar said that of the 120 crore people in India, 50% are below the age of 25 and that is why, it is imperative to focus on issues affecting the youth and to understand the challenges they face. Though HIV has declined in Goa in recent years, the government wants to take it to zero level and also do away with the stigma attached to it., , Another highlight of the function is the testimonies given by two teenagers from Bengaluru. Babu Seenappa, 14, and Manik Prabhu, 16, both represented India in the international children’s games in Netherlands in June this year. Both are HIV positive and reside at Sneha Care Home, Bengaluru. Seenappa was born with HIV but now competes in 5km and 10km races.

He could walk over 3km a day without any support. 

, ""I did not think I could live. It's only because of self-confidence and moral support that I could survive,"" says Keshava. Initially, he did not take treatment due to financial constraints. He owned a petty shop to sustain his family. In 2011, his health deteriorated and he was bedridden, unable to even move his hands. Doctors sent him back home losing all hope, he added. 
,
, His mother Sathyavathi says she owes it all to the Swami Vivekananda Youth Movement (SVYM). ""If my son is alive, it's only because of SVYM and its volunteers' moral support,"" she says. 
,
, Despite his failing health, he did small jobs like starting a mobile recharge shop to support his family. 
,
, Thanks to the palliative care facility of SVYM, the bedridden patients and their families get support. The facility, apart from taking care of patients, also helps their family members to avail governmental benefits. ""Now, I am receiving widow pension and my son is getting pension from the government. Palliative care volunteers helped me get these benefits,"" said Sathyavathi. 
,
, The CD4 count in HIV patients should be above 350 but if the count falls below that, patients may become bedridden and the risks are very high, says district AIDS controller Dr T Raghu Kumar. Keshava had CD4 count below 50 when palliative care volunteers visited him in 2012. 
,
, Like him, more than 300 bedridden needy patients have availed palliative care. Today, some of them are leading a dignified life. ""The goal is to improve the quality of life for patients and their families. The need of palliative care is essential in terminal and chronic diseases as they are incurable and result in physical, psychological, socio-economic strain to individuals and their families,"" says palliative care volunteer Dr Deepak Murthy.

, 
, Seven years ago, when city-based , inspector , launched this matrimonial website dedicated to matchmaking of HIV-positive people, he never thought his initiative would get such a huge response.
, 
, ""We do not have the resources to follow up on our registered users, but we conservatively estimate that at least 500 marriages have been fixed among our users. The number can even be double of that,"" Valiv said.

, Valiv was posted in Latur in 2006 when he heard about an HIV positive man looking for a bride and thought of starting a website that connects HIV positive people. Operating out of a small office in Mangalwar Peth, PositiveSaathi.com has emerged as a relative success story. It registers bride and groom-seekers for free, regularly organises matrimonial meets and has quite a few success stories to its credit. One such matrimonial meet was held in Mumbai on Saturday in association with the ,.
, 
, ""We have had to convince potential users that we verify the users' background regularly, and that their identities shall be secured to all possible extents,"" Valiv said.
, 
, Among the first marriages the website forged was that of an HIV-positive boy from Hyderabad, who was working in Singapore, with a London-based Indian girl who had divorced her husband after she found she had contracted the infection from him. She also had a daughter. Both had registered themselves on the website and after meeting and talking to each other, they decided to tie the knot.
, 
, Administrators of the website say that the matrimonial process is fairly arduous and one that requires them to stay alert. There are many fake profiles and profiles of married people too, which is why they have to frequently revisit their databases and carry out background checks of users.
, 
, 
,
, 
, ""Another problem is the male-to-female registration ratio on our website as well as in our matrimonial meets is heavily skewed. For every 10 male registrations, only about two to three , register. Also, after the potential bride and groom meet through the website or via the meetings, aspects like financial condition, caste, creed, and religion do come up,"" he said.
, 
, The success stories more than make up for the hassles. ""In 2012, we had organised a similar matrimonial meet for HIV-positive persons in Pune, and to our surprise, five couples who met that day went to a , and got married,"" one of the website administrators said.
, 
, Then there was the case of a 34-year-old HIV-positive woman from Pune who was encouraged by her uncles to get married again after her divorce. She came to know about our website from her doctor. Her profile was soon uploaded on the website where she connected with a man from Mumbai. They got married two years ago.

In fact, we collaborated with the state AIDS control society for the first time during our Mumbai meet.

Accusing the staff of discriminating against HIV patients, Advocacy officer of Vihaan Project (National AIDS Control Organisation), Amruta Alpesh Soni, said the only reason why the morgue staff left the body on the stretcher was that they didn’t wasn’t to physically lift it with their hands, as the deceased had died due to AIDS. , 	Talking to TOI, Soni said she and her team were in the hospital last night and they would have shifted the body to the freezer if the morgue staff had even given them a hint. “We reached there this morning around noon to collect the body and to our utter shock found the body lying in open at the same place where we had seen it last night”, she said accusing the hospital staff of purposely leaving the body there. , 	Denying any motives behind the incident, head of the Forensic Medicine department, Dr Ullas Gunade said, “it’s a non-issue, as bodies can be kept outside the freezer for 24 hours”. He said there has been no indiscrimination and the body was stored, as was needed. , 	However, Soni questioned the logic of keeping the dead body in open for nearly 17 hours in this sultry heat despite the fact that all freezers were unoccupied. She said the room where the body was kept was not even air-conditioned. She even alleged that there were ants on the body when they picked it up this morning. , 	Accusing the government of doing little for HIV+ orphaned children, Soni said there about 400 such children in the state and there is no rehabilitation policy for them, making their lives miserable. “These orphans have been left to fend for themselves and they suffer discrimination everyday”, she said. , 	Soni said People Living with HIV (PLHIV) had given a proposal to Women and Child Welfare department four months back for setting up a home for such children but nothing has been done so far.

This came to light during a media sensitization workshop in Shimla wherein HIV positive people shared life experiences. , The workshop was organized by Mamta Health Institute for Mother and Child, New Delhi, in collaboration with Himachal Pradesh State AIDS Control Society and Himachal Pradesh Voluntary Health Association. Shreshtha (name changed), a woman from Kangra district, was thrown out of her house by her in-laws on coming to know about her HIV status. This despite the fact that she was infected by her husband, a truck driver and was forced to live in misery along with her two children. However, she was lucky to get help of village panchayats and a local NGO. Today, she is heading an organization that works in association with panchayati raj institutions to create awareness about HIV positive people. In 2011, she was also awarded the best social worker award., , Bhago (name changed), another HIV positive woman from Kangra district, was passed on the infection by her husband. However, the damage catapult as by the time she came to know about her being HIV positive, she had three children from the marriage. She earns her livelihood by working as daily wager and fear of being stigmatized by the society is not letting her reveal her status. , , Women alone are not the ones to suffer. Sohan Lal (name changed) from Bilaspur was detected with HIV in 1990, but till date he has not revealed his being HIV positive to his relatives and villagers as he fears to he will be ostracized once he reveals the truth. ""I could reveal this to my family members only after five years,"" he added., , Himachal Pradesh health director Dr D S Gurung said that 30 NGOs are working for HIV positive people in the state. He said drug abuse is increasing in border areas of the state and that is leading increasing cases of HIV too., , He said that recently a meeting was held in which a proposal to provide pension to HIV positive people and bus passes for free travel for treatment was discussed too., , A health official said that female sex workers are being provided vocation training and 550 have already been included under livelihood training. Vocation training to them would be provided at Industrial Training Institutes of Nahan, kala Amb, Solan, Bilaspur, Mandi, Shimla, Nalagrh and Baddi., , , , Though Himachal Pradesh falls under the category of low prevalent state where the infection rate among the adult HIV prevalence is 0.17% with total count of positive persons at 8,091, efforts are on to nail down the causes that are resulting in spread of HIV/AIDS.

,

, ""In earlier studies, we knew that we could interfere with the spread of HIV-1, but we couldn't identify the mechanism that was stopping the process,"" said Yong-Hui Zheng, Michigan State University (MSU) associate professor and co-author of the study. 
,
, ""We now know that ERManI is an essential key, and that it has the potential as a antiretroviral treatment,"" said Zheng. 
,
, Antiretroviral treatments are not vaccines; they simply keep HIV in check in low levels in the body. 
,
, While it could be decades before an ERManI-based treatment can be prescribed for HIV-1 patients, these results provide a strong path for future research involving human cells, and later, clinical tests. 
,
, The next steps will be to test if HIV resistance can be promoted by increasing ERManI levels, said Zheng, who worked on the study with scientists from the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the University of Georgia. 
,
, Most viruses have viral envelopes, or protective skins, that comprise similar building blocks of the host the pathogens are trying to infect. 
,
, On the surface of the envelope, there are viral glycoproteins, known as Env spikes, which act as valets, leading viruses to binding sites that allow infections to spread at the molecular level. 
,
, They serve as a key of sorts that gives viruses entry into the host to begin spreading. 
,
, Zheng's lab was the first to show that HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein biosynthesis can be specifically inhibited by ERManI, which is a host enzyme to add sugars to proteins. 
,
, By identifying ERManI as the target that slows the spread of HIV-1, the team showed a target in which future natural therapies can be developed. 
,
, More than 1.2 million people in the US have HIV. In China, doctors diagnosed 104,000 new cases of HIV/AIDS in 2014. The number of infections is rising, though overall the country still has a low rate of infection. 
,
, Currently, there is no cure for HIV-1; once patients have it, they have it for life. While there are antiretroviral therapies available, they can only prolong life, albeit dramatically, but they cannot cure the disease. 
,
, Current drug treatments have to be taken for a lifetime, which causes side effects and many other issues, Zheng said. 
,
, ""We see a way to treat this disease by helping the body protect itself,"" he said.

,
, While existing , (ART) stops the HIV virus from replicating, it does not completely remove the virus. Destroying the hidden reservoirs of the virus remains one of the holy grails of HIV research. 
,
, Led by Oxford researcher professor John Frater, the international research team analysed data from a randomised study of patients with primary HIV infection. 
,
, They compared the T-cells of 154 patients in Europe, Brazil and Australia who had their ART treatment interrupted after 12 or 48 weeks. 
,
, T-cells play a central role in protecting the immune system. 
,
, After coming up with a shortlist of 18 immune system biomarkers, researchers discovered that three of them -- PD-1, Tim-3 and Lag-3 -- were statistically significant predictors of when the virus would rebound. 
,
, The researchers found that high levels of these biomarkers, attached to 'exhausted' T-cells prior to patients commencing ART, were associated with earlier rebound of the virus following treatment interruption. 
,
, ""Focusing on the exhaustion markers was an important step as it has given us vital clues as to why some people are able to better control the virus after therapy has been interrupted,"" said Professor Rodney Phillips from UNSW.

, Patients with , are encouraged to participate in regular checkups to keep track of their health. In high resource settings, devices known as flow cytometers complete the tests by analysing the blood. 
,
, Flow cytometers, however, are bulky machines that run on electricity. The machines also cost upwards of USD 50,000. 
,
, ""Flow cytometers are not practical for areas with limited resources like Africa or Mexico,"" said Thomas Boland, a professor of metallurgical, materials and biomedical engineering at University of Texas at El Paso who created a less expensive, battery-powered health monitoring tool for use in third world countries. 
,
, The portable device works by helping clinicians count the number of CD4 cells - cells that are attacked by HIV - in the body. 
,
, After drawing a patient's blood, clinicians mix in magnetic microscale beads that latch on to CD4 cells in the blood. The mixture is then placed in an inkjet printer that's been modified to print out cells instead of ink. 
,
, Rather than printing vertically onto a sheet of paper, the cells are shot out horizontally onto a magnetised microscopic slide. 
,
, CD4 cells in the blood automatically attach to the slide, while other cells that do not need to be counted dribble down into an excess container. 
,
, Doctors can then look at the slide through a microscope to count the number of CD4 cells on it. That number is inserted into an equation that calculates the total number of CD4 cells in the individual's body. 
,
, The procedure takes as little as 20 minutes, resulting in ultra-quick results. 
,
, Boland hopes his new printer will help doctors and patients in low-resource settings who don't have access to flow cytometers. 
,
, The next step in the process is to license the technology to a company that is willing to help get it on the market. Several doctors in Mexico have already expressed interest in the device, Boland said.

They will continue the drive till Diwali, they said. , 	Speaking about the endeavour, team members B Shaanraj, V Sivabalan, R Arunkumar and A Manojkumar said the response from the public are encouraging. In the past three days, they have received donation of Rs 5000. After hearing about our initiative, some people give new clothes, they said. “Many of them select the children from our list and contribute money asking us to buy new clothes for them,” Shaan raj said. “We should also thank the generosity of the textile showroom for giving us the space,” Sivabalan stated. , 	Most of the members, who are studying in various places, have decided to spend their puja holidays in this manner. “Our members have already undertaken similar initiatives in Chennai by collecting money from people. However, in Madurai we have directly put up a collection centre at a textile showroom,” Manojkumar said. , 	In most cases, the beneficiaries – HIV-affected children, are either living with single parent as one of the parent has succumbed to AIDS or they live in homes as both parents are dead. “We want to make Diwali a time of celebration for these children. Fifteen members from our forum and volunteers from colleges are participating in this drive,” M Kishore Kumar, one of the coordinators of Padikkattugal said. , 	They have collected donors’ contact details and will invite them when they distribute clothes to the children in a small event, which will be organised in the city, he added. , "
"Updated: Nov 1, 2015, 17:05 IST",Breaking the news to children living with HIV: a non-profit takes the lead in Ecuador," 	GUAYAQUIL: Jean's book of heroes occupies pride of place at a clinic run by Fundacion VIHDA, a non-profit working to prevent transmission of HIV from mother to child in Ecuador's largest city, Guayaquil. One would expect illustrations of princes to jump out of the pages of her book. Instead, there are handmade drawings of her grandmother. , 	Since her mother's death, Jean, who has tested HIV positive, is being looked after by her grandmother. The biggest concern for families like hers is how to break the news to a child about his/her HIV status. This concern prompted Fundacion VIHDA to come up with a programme for diagnostic disclosure of HIV to children and to prepare them for their life ahead. Two years since, 15 children, having an average age of 10 to 12 years, have completed the programme. , 	Globally, 3.2 million children, under the age of 15, were living with HIV in 2013, according to UNAIDS. They comprised 9.1% of all people living with HIV. 240,000 children worldwide acquired HIV in 2013: one new infection every two minutes. , 	""A significant number of kids in Ecuador acquire the HIV virus from their mothers who may not have been able to receive treatment on time to prevent transmission to the child. As kids grow up, they start asking questions. They know how to read signs at hospitals and labels on flasks. It is important for the child to know that he is not sick and that he has rights,"" says clinical psychologist Dr. Claudia Zambrano, one of the founding members of Fundacion VIHDA. , 	Zambrano and her team have individual sessions, every fortnight, for children living with HIV that approach the clinic. A specific action plan is drawn up based on the personal situation of every child. ""We work with the child's personal history, their specific life circumstances and his/her family, in order to address their needs. The children are taught about wholesome health, just like in school. They are given a general idea about medical conditions, concepts like viral load (amount of HIV in a blood sample), drugs and how they react in the body,"" says Zambrano.Group sessions are held with peers after a couple of months so the child gets a support network. , 	Nine-year-old Valentina had stumped a bunch of paramedics at her school when she told them that she had HIV. She had learnt of her diagnosis from her aunt and did not confide in her friends. But when the paramedics started quizzing students about their allergies and medical conditions, Valentina thought it was okay to tell. ""Valentina was nervous when the paramedics spoke to her teachers. I went over to her school and met the authorities. We spoke to Valentina and strengthened the feeling that there was nothing wrong with her,"" said Zambrano. After that episode at school, things changed as Valentina's teachers and principal were more open to the topic. Valentina continued two years more in the same school and is now in college. She comes regularly to the Fundacion VIHDA clinic and discusses updates in her life as a teenager, occasionally attending some of the group sessions held for younger kids living with HIV. , 	The diagnostic disclosure programme has no fixed duration. ""Kids come to us at different stages. Some of them approach us in crisis after getting to know of their diagnosis in difficult situations. In such cases, we have to work on repair and stress on the fact that although the HIV status is an integral aspect of the child's life, it does not define him as a person. We seek family support and also counsel families on tackling the situation,"" says a member of the psychological counselling team at Fundacion VIHDA. Children in crisis are burdened with a lot of questions and anxieties. They know they have greater physical restrictions than other kids their age. Some of them fear they would die like their mother did. Others are worried that they would get sick often and may not have money to pay for medication in future. ""Children are taught to keep information about their health situation private and not disclose it to any of their friends or acquaintances. But there have been situations where classmates or teachers have found out and started discriminating against them. In such cases, parents or grandparents are encouraged to deal with the situation firmly as we have laws against discrimination of people living with HIV. The child may change schools to overcome discrimination. They work very hard to regain self-esteem and overcome that episode,"" says Zambrano. , 	At Enrique Sotomayor, the largest maternity hospital in Guayaquil where 20% of Ecuador's children are born, a team headed by Dr. Mercedes Ortiz have been fighting to bring down the number of mother-to-child transmissions, despite scarce resources and cultural stigma against HIV. ""The risk of transmission from mother-to-child can occur during pregnancy, breastfeeding or birth. We provide information to all our female patients on why it's important to get tested for HIV and how to prevent transmission of the virus to their babies,"" says Ortiz. , 	From the moment of diagnosis, antiretroviral (ARV) medication has to be administered to the pregnant woman and it has to continue indefinitely. Prior to the birth of the child, these ARVs reduce the amount of virus in the bloodstream and prevent transmission from mother-to-child. On birth, babies must be given infant antiretrovirals during the first month of their life and they have to remain under medical observation till they are 18. , 	(This article was supported by the International Reporting Project.

This was a bid to help these children and women live a normal life despite being affected by the immunodeficiency virus. , 	In a function organized by the Coimbatore District HIV Ullor Nala Sangam, a set of new clothes and a box of sweets were distributed to around 120 children who have either been infected or affected by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus. Saris and sweets were also distributed to 80 women, who were widowed and infected with the virus. , 	The function which began with gift distribution, also included a celebratory lunch and a couple of confidence building speeches. People were not allowed to photograph or video tape the event because many children and women were there without their family, friends or neighbours’ knowledge. “Though we organize the function to always convince HIV affected people that they can lead a normal life, in reality it is very difficult,” said a senior member of the sangam R Meenakshi. “A majority of the people, infected by HIV, who attended the function on Saturday, live completely anonymous lives. The children’s classmates and friends usually do not know their status, the women’s colleagues and neighbours too do not know that they are infected,” she said. “The minute word gets out that they are infected, they face a lot of discrimination and ostracization,” she said. “This is the only time they can admit to being affected by HIV and yet have a nice time,” she added. , 	The clothes and the sweets were sponsored by four good samaritans who have been contributing to this function for the past 13 years. “This is the 13th year that we are celebrating this function,” said Meenakshi. , "

, 

, The US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has approved Genvoya — a fixed-dose combination tablet containing elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide — as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and paediatric patients aged 12 and above.
, 
, 
, 
, 
,
, Though the drug is currently not available in India, experts say approval in the US is a major breakthrough and may trigger trials for the medicine in India, which has the third highest number of HIV-infected people in the world. Currently, India has over 20 lakh people living with HIV, while there are around 1.5 lakh children infected with the virus. Though India demonstrated an overall reduction of 57% in the annual new HIV infections among adults, it still witnesses around 1.2 lakh new infections and 1.5 lakh AIDS-related deaths every year. 
,
, “Today’s approval of a fixed dose combination containing a new form of tenofovir provides another effective, once-daily, complete regimen for patients with HIV-1 infection,” said Edward Cox, director of the Office of Antimicrobial Products at USFDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. 
,
, According to USFDA, Genvoya contains a new form of tenofovir that has not been previously approved. This new form provides lower levels of drug in the bloodstream, but higher levels within the cells, where HIV-1 replicates. “It was developed to help reduce some drug ,,” the regulator said.
, 
, 
, 
, 
,
, According to USFDA, the , also appears to be associated with less kidney toxicity and decreases in bone density than previously approved tenofovir-containing regimens based on laboratory measures. 
,
, The American regulator has approved the medicine for children weighing at least 35 kilograms (77 pounds) who have never taken HIV therapy and HIV-infected adults whose HIV-1 virus is currently suppressed. 
,
, The drug, not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment, will also carry a ‘Boxed Warning’ alerting patients and healthcare providers that the drug can cause a buildup of lactic acid in the blood and severe liver problems, both of which can be fatal. The ‘Boxed Warning’ also states that Genvoya is not approved to treat chronic hepatitis B virus infection. 
,
, The drug should not be prescribed with other antiretroviral products as it may have drug interactions with a number of other commonly used medications.

"Updated: Nov 19, 2015, 03:40 IST,Representative image. (Thinkstock photos/Getty Images)",HIV+ boy driven out of school in Kolkata,"KOLKATA: A seven-year-old boy has been hounded out of a private school in southern suburb Bishupur by guardians of other students after his mother voluntarily declared that he was HIV+. 

, The student—Shaan—has been studying in the Bengali-medium Deepsikha Nursery School that has students up to class III. The child's mother, ironically an NGO worker engaged in , awareness, has resolved that if her son does continue studies, it will be at Deepsikha or not at all. The grandmother, who is a Bengali teacher in the very school, had to undergo HIV test to prove she was not a carrier before being allowed to continue. 
,
, Shaan's mother Sujata learned about his condition mid-January when he was tested after she herself had tested positive the previous month. Her husband Sanjit had earlier been detected HIV+ in May 2014. Though devastated by the test result, Sujata who is engaged in awareness on HIV and AIDS for an NGO decided to immediately inform the school headmaster on ethical grounds. 
,
, “Since my son studies with others, it is important that the teachers know about it so that if he is hurt and suffers a cut leading to blood loss, he is handled carefully and does not infect others. Sanjib Naskar, the headmaster, was extremely nice and assured me that he would personally ensure that Shaan did not face any trouble,” she recounted. 
,
, Life carried on as usual till June when Sujata received a bolt from the blue. Naskar called her one day and told her that her son could not study in the school any longer as other guardians were opposed to it. 
,
, “I didn't even know that word had got around and everyone knew Shaan's condition. When I reminded the headmaster about the assurance, he pleaded helplessness as he was under pressure. No amount of reasoning helped,” she said. Though Sujata did send him to school the following day, he was not allowed entry. Shaan has stayed home since. 
,
, Sujata alleged that a school teacher even telephoned her and rebuked her for trying to questioning the headmaster's decision. “No one has any idea about HIV. When I tried to explain that other kids were not at threat, they refused to listen and remained adamant,” she said. 
,
, The ingorance is such that Shaan's grandmother, a Bengali teacher in the school, was forced to undergo blood tests and allowed to continue only after the results were negative. 
,
, When TOI asked the headmaster why he had reneged on his assurance, Naskar did a U-turn and said that he hadn't shut the door on Shaan but had only informed his mother about the objections from other guardians. “I want him to attend school but the parents are not sending him. But it is true that over 100 guardians signed a petition and submitted to me for Shaan's removal from the school,” he said. 
,
, On an after-thought, Naskar added that the child's fees were also due for several months. Sujata acknowledged that fees had not been paid for several months but claimed it was because the headmaster had waived the fees. 
,
, District magistrate PB Saleem said he was aware of the mother's complaint and had asked the block development officer to conduct a thorough enquiry into it to ascertain the facts. “Whatever be the case, the child's education must not be affected. I will do whatever it takes to get him back to school,” he said.

"Nov 14, 2015, 04:32 IST",HIV-2 surfaces in Goa; 15 cases detected in 2 yrs,"Panaji: Though HIV-1 is as predominant a virus in Goa as elsewhere, HIV-2 cases are slowly coming to the fore. Known as a silent killer, about 15 cases of the HIV-2 strain have been detected in Goa in the last two years. As with HIV-1, the mode of transmissions of HIV-2 is through sex and from mother-to-child during pregnancy. The medication for both the strains differ.
 
, Confirming the developments of the HIV-2 strain, Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital, anti-retroviral therapy centre’s (ART) senior medical officer, Dr Vanda Viegas said, “It is a worrying factor as the detection of HIV-2 is not as easy as HIV-1. The strain can remain undetected in the body for five-six years.”
, 
, “HIV-2 virus will not cause any harm to the person for few years, but after that the decline in the health of the carrier is steady,” Viegas said. If a person doesn’t get treatment on time, she said, early death is imminent.
, 
, Asked what could have triggered the HIV-2 cases in the state, Viegas said it cannot be pinpointed without thorough research, and that the new cases have been reported to the higher authorities.
, 
, Of the 15 HIV-2 cases detected, Viegas said ten were migrants including a South Indian couple. Quite a few cases of HIV-2 strain have been detected in some states in South India.
, 
, She said the South Indian couple was put on a therapy – protease inhibitors, a type of antiviral drug, and though initially showed to be responding, they stopped visiting ART centre on the scheduled dates.
, 
, “We don’t know whether they are dead or alive,” she added. In fact, this is a typical problem faced by the ART centre as some of the patients registered for treatment don’t show up after the first few visits.
, 
, The problem is more so with migrants who disappear after the first few visits. The officials at the ART centre find it difficult to locate them as they lack proper addresses.

, Talking to TOI, President of CNP+, Rinki Arora said the orphan child, who was living with his relatives in Durg, was on first line treatment but due to failure of medicines, he was referred to Raipur ART centre one year back. Rinki said since Raipur ART has the facility of providing second line drugs in the state, they had been pursuing the matter with them for the child’s treatment but the same was being delayed on one pretext or the other. 
,
, She said due to lack of treatment, the child’s condition had started worsening and they contacted State AIDS Control Society (SACS), Additional Project director, Dr SK Binjhwar, who in turn directed the Raipur ART centre on Wednesday to start the treatment the very next day. Rinki said when they contacted the ART on Thursday morning, they were asked to get the child on Nov 24, despite being told about his critical condition. 
,
, She said the child succumbed to his infection on Thursday afternoon. Blaming the ART for the child’s death, Rinki said for the past one year the child was denied treatment despite follow ups with the authorities. She said this is not the first such case and claimed that seven other HIV patients have died due to the same reasons. 
,
, When TOI contacted Dr Binjhwar, he denied the allegations and said, “Apparently there was some communication gap”, Insisting that the child was not denied medication or treatment, Binjhwar said the child’s relatives were asked to bring him to the ART on Thursday but they never came. 
,
, When asked why the child was denied treatment for this long despite being referred to the ART for second line treatment over a year back, Binjhwar said the patient’s report of viral load test, which was sent to Kolkata, had not been received so far. He said this report, which measures the number of HIV virus particles in a milliliter of blood, is essential for deciding the correct dosage for the patient. 
,
, However, Binjhwar admitted that medicines could have been provided to the child, under expert guidance, since he was in a critical condition.

They indicated this by their silence, though. It was enough for an “unanimous decision” for the child to return to school from Monday. , 	The child, whose parents are HIV+, was detected as a carrier of the virus in January. However, his mother, who works as a volunteer in HIV awareness, informed principal Sanjib Naskar. She felt the school authorities need to know and take necessary precautions should the boy hurt himself and bleed. , 	However, in June Naskar informed the child’s mother that several guardians have submitted a petition, demanding expulsion of her son.

They indicated this by their silence, though. It was enough for a “unanimous decision” for the child will return to school from Monday. , 	On Thursday, TOI had reported that the child, whose parents are HIV+, was detected as a carrier of the virus in January. Instead of keeping the matter hidden, his mother — who works as a volunteer in HIV awareness — informed principal Sanjib Naskar. She felt that school authorities need to know and take necessary precautions should the boy hurt himself and bleed. Handling HIV+ blood without necessary precautions can result in spreading of the virus. , 	Things were fine till June when Naskar informed the child’s mother that several guardians have submitted a petition, demanding that her son’s name be struck off the rolls. The boy’s grandmother, who teaches in the same school, was made to undergo a test to prove that she is not an HIV carrier. Naskar, however, told TOI that the child’s mother was raising the issue after the school demanded that she pay up pending fees The woman countered that it was Naskar who had waived the fees. , 	On coming to know of the issue, South 24-Parganas district magistrate P B Saleem promised to ensure that the boy gets to study in that very school. On Saturday, he called a meeting of guardians and teachers. This was attended by Alipore SDO Praloy Majumder, the district chief medical officer-health, MLA Dilip Mondal and several NGO members who work with HIV patients. , 	After the medical experts and NGOs spoke on HIV+ and how it doesn’t spread through normal day-to -day activities, some parents still expressed their reservations. They asked the experts whether they would have said the same had their children studied in that school. Many demanded that the boy be isolated in a classroom. About 80% started out protesting the inclusion. In the end though, two parents spoke of behalf of everyone and said they have no problem if the boy studies in the school provided he has a special maid to look after him. , 	Naskar then brought up the issue of pending fees, saying the boy had not paid his dues for two years. Local MLA Dilip Mondal and social worker Sailen Ghosh said they would clear the dues and arrange for a special maid, thereby clearing the path for the child’s education. "

"Updated: Nov 6, 2017, 11:54 IST",Major signs and early symptoms of HIV infection,"HIV (human immunodeficiency infection) is an infection that attacks our body's immune system, the body's natural protection framework. Without a solid safe framework, the body experiences difficulty fending off malady. 

,HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It is the virus that can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS. HIV is a virus spread through certain body fluids that attacks the body’s natural immune system. The damage to the immune system makes it harder and harder for the body to fight off infections and some other diseases. Here are a few signs and , of HIV which you should look out for.
,
,
,
,One symptom that comes in the very beginning is fever known as Acute Retroviral Syndrome (ARS). Fever is ordinarily accompanied with symptoms like tiredness and body torment.
,
,
,
,At the point when the infection enters the blood, the vulnerable immune system is hit. Likewise, aggravation because of poor immunity causes exhaustion and fatigue.
,
,
,
,Rash is the most common symptom of HIV. For a person with HIV, the skin can become extremely sensitive to irritants and sunlight. This effect can show up at the beginning or at a later stage. On the off chance that the skin rash isn't effortlessly treated then it could be because of the ,.
,
,
,
,The people suffering from HIV or those who have just fallen sick with HIV generally lose weight rapidly due to the above symptoms.
, 
,
,
,Dry cough should be immediately treated with common treatments. If it is done so, this persistent coughing can lead to pneumonia, which is a sign of the HIV virus.
, 
,
,
,These squeamish inclinations which are not effectively treated could suggest HIV contamination.
,
,
,
,Lymph nodes shape some portion of the resistant framework which is our immune system. When the immune system is tainted by HIV virus, the lymph nodes get inflamed giving a sign of HIV disease.
,
,
,
,HIV infected individuals also experience night sweats. This symptom is very similar to women entering menopause.
, 
,There are a few ways which may help you beat the HIV virus. Here we have mentioned those natural ways that you can add into your daily life and habits to stay safe from the HIV virus.
,
,
, Fast for at least 1 day a week. Drink only the concoction made of distilled water, lemon juice and honey.
, 
,
, Eat predigested proteins for maximum digestion. Products like soy milk contain soy protein and yogurt culture, and are great for health as well.
, 
,
, Eat cultured proteins like yogurt made from soy milk, that is easily absorbed and digested, and contains acidophilus. This friendly flora produces lactic acid which destroys the bad bacteria.
, 
,
,Take protein digestive enzymes if you eat hard to digest proteins like meat, eggs, fish or fowl.
, 
, Eliminate those proteins from the diet that are hard to digest, like casein from dairy products and gluten’s from wheat and, coagulated proteins from like in fried meats.

, The present method to screen HIV has a four-week window period (the time between a person is infected and the , infection starts showing up in the tests).
, 
, The decision to introduce NAT came about when health minister Deepak Sawant was reviewing HIV , cases in the state in a meeting with Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS).
, 
, The minister was informed that of the 11 lakh donor blood samples tested across the state, more than 2,500 were found to be HIV+. This means that these HIV+ had donated blood during the window period (and probably did not know that they were infected). The minister was also told that NAT test ing is very important to reduce the risk of HIV infection though blood transfusion.
, 
, To put things in perspective, at least 1,000 people in Maharashtra contracted HIV in the past five years due to blood transfusions.
, 
, ""It was in January this year that the NAT proposal was discussed with the health minister and he finally pushed the proposal to the Centre,"" said Khushalsinh Pardeshi, Project Director, MSCAS.
, 
, Presently all blood banks follow the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) guidelines and use fourth generation HIV Elisa testing kits to screen blood for HIV.
, 
, According to Pardesi, NACO has sanctioned Rs 18 crore for the NAT test. Six districts -Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad, Nashik, Nagpur and Ahmedanagar -will have NAT centers and around 300 blood banks will be attached to the centers. Blood samples from all over the state will be sent to one of these centers for testing.
, 
, Currently, only two private hospitals in the city - Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani hospital (Andheri) and PD Hinduja hospital (Mahim) have NAT equipment.
, 
, While a single ELISA test cost Rs 200, NAT costs Rs 1,000 per test.

On the other, there seems to be a reduction in the central government funds to NACO (National AIDS Control Organisation) for AIDS control programmes and IEC activities (information, education and communication) undertaken through the various SACS (State AIDS Control Society)., , According to officials of the AP State AIDS Control Society (APSACS), in 2014-15, 32,190 new HIV cases were identified in the state with Guntur, East Godavari and Krishna being the most vulnerable districts mainly due to presence of high number of migrants and truckers. Between April to September 2015, 4,00,090 got tested, out of which 12,742 were confirmed as HIV positive in AP. Currently, 1,28,760 people are living with HIV and are under medication in AP, among which 11,566 are from Vizag district. ""In accordance with the theme of 'Getting to Zero- Zero New HIV Infections, Zero Stigma and Discrimination, Zero AIDS Related Deaths', the overall incidence of HIV/AIDS is coming down in the state but we still don't have a comparative statistics yet as the entire data of the combined state is with Telangana and we are trying to get the AP data post bifurcation. Even then, if we compare the overall prevalence among the high risk groups at present with those three-four years ago, we find that in almost all cases, the prevalence rate has come down,"" stated additional project director (APD) of APSACS Rajendra Prasad., , ""In ante-natal women, the prevalence rate is 0.1% now as compared to more than 1.5% three-four years earlier. Similarly, in female sex workers, it has come down from 8% to 4% and in MSMs (men who have sex with men) it's 8% as compared to 10% three years ago. Only in case of Injectable Drug Users (IDUs), the cases have gone up from 8% to 10%. We are trying to implement employer-need models in industries to generate awareness among workers too. We also feel the need for generation of continuous awareness and more IEC activities, which has slowed down,"" Prasad said., , Speaking on IEC and other issues, an official from Naco working with State Aids Control Society, requesting anonymity, said, ""There's some problem regarding availability of funds to fight AIDS. The combined state of AP-Telangana got Rs 115 crore in 2014. But this year, only Rs 94 crore has been given by the Centre. In fact, the central government has asked the respective state governments to contribute 20 per cent of the funds. Given the fund crunch in the two states, such a move may hamper AIDS control programmes. Even IEC activities need to be continued without gaps because today's children would be tomorrow's youth and therefore a sustainable approach is needed to curtail incidence of HIV.

"Updated: Dec 2, 2015, 13:51 IST",HIV infections on decline in Gujarat's AIDS capital,"SURAT: The Diamond City that had acquired the dubious distinction of being the AIDS capital of Gujarat has now started showing signs of improvement. Number of new HIV infections have shown a decline of 15-20% in the last five years. The reason, believe experts, is primarily the control mechanism put in place by the local AIDS control authority.
 
, However, Surat has a long way to go as it still tops the state with the highest number of ,.
, 
, In Gujarat, there are 48,917 people suffering from , of which 26,955 are male and 18,687 female. There are 2,975 children below the age of 15 years who are living with HIV/AIDS. In Surat alone, there are 9,998 people who are HIV positive (5,734 male and 3,785 female) with 479 children according to Gujarat State Network of People (GSNP) living with HIV/AIDS and state government.
, 
, Dr Mukul Choksi, a psychiatrist who treats number of patients attributes the decline to fear factor and training of sex workers by NGOs and government. ""On one hand, we have fear among people be it educated or uneducated class. This has led to adoption of safe sex practices to larger extent. On the other hand, large number of sex workers have been trained to practice safe sex and it is being practised widely.""
, 
, A senior medical officer of Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre in Surat said that improved services at ART centres and increased awareness has also led to fall in new infections. ""Once an infected patient is introduced to ART drugs, viral load of HIV goes down in his body and transmission risks decreases. This coupled with number of awareness campaigns and safe sex practices has started giving positive results and we hope it will serve its purpose in another 10 years,"" said Dr Alap Mehta, senior medical officer of Surat ART center.
, 
, Daxa Patel, of GSNP said, ""It is good that new infections have come down, but we only hope that social taboos and social indignation that many AIDS/HIV patients face also comes down.""
,

When her husband – who works in Mumbai to provide for his family – came back home this Diwali, she insisted on an HIV test before he entered home. But, her husband wouldn’t agree. So, Anita decided he would not let him share her bed till he was in Udaisarai.
 
, Vidya, another resident of this village and a mother of two, too would not allow her husband Ram Kishore enter home till a blood test showed he was HIV negative.
, 
, Not that Anita and Vidya were not happy that their husbands were home for Diwali. But, they were scared that they could get with them more them the money and Diwali gifts for all. They were afraid the men may get them disease and death – carrying back home with them the deadly HIV.
, 
, The , in this village, where most make members work in Mumbai for a living, have united and are fighting this virus in a unique way: They are making the menfolk – through persuasion and even force – under a test to check for HIV as soon as they reach the village from Mumbai.
, 
, Their fears aren’t misplaced. For, Udaisarai was like any other village in Uttar Pradesh – surviving on income from agriculture and money orders from men working in Mumbai and other cities in western India – till a screening camp 10 years ago made their world turn topsy turvy.
, 
, Results of blood tests in the camp revealed most of the males were carrying the deadly virus.
, 
, The village, with a population … and with members from about 200 homes working in other states, has lost as many as 44 people in the past decade.
, 
, With death staring them in the face, women have taken strong steps. And, if the wives are ensuring HIV tests for husbands and safe sex, they are being supported by their mothers-in-law and sisters-in-law.
, 
, “We are helping them save themselves from the scourge of infection and stigma. This Diwali, the women told the men to get themselves tested for HIV when the returned home,” said Gyan Swaroopa, an anganwadi worker who has played a key role in spreading awareness in the village.
, 
, It was Vidya who took the lead and made her husband undergo a blood test at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre at the Fatehpur district hospital.
, 
, “I have seen members of families which got infected die one by one. Even medicines do not work. The trauma is unbearable. So, I asked my husband to get himself checked,” said Vidya.
, 
, But not all spouses are cooperative. Anita had to struggle to make her husband take the test. “I did not let him into my room for two days as he refused to take the test. I even did not let him share my bed for , of the days,” she said.
, 
, “It was my mother-in-law who made him agree, reminding him of the deaths village have died. Village elders too convinced him and he donated his sample before leaving for Mumbai. The report is awaited,” she added.
, 
, When Sangeeta’s husband came home for Diwali, it was her sister-in-law, who herself had lost her husband, who convinced him for the test. Sangeeta’s family heaved a sigh of relief when he turned out to be HIV negative. Sangeeta had stopped communicating with her husband till he agreed.
, 
, But, when ,, who was married just about six months ago, could not convince her husband for the test, she ensured that he used condoms.
, 
, But not all had it easy. When another resident Rani Devi insisted that her husband underwent a test, he retorted: “Tum humko bataogi ki kya karna hai (Will you tell me what I should do?).”
, 
, ASHA worker Karuna Devi said threat of importing HIV infection from
, 
, Mumbai still looms over the hamlet. Village head Dharam Raj revealed that at least 250 residents from 200 families worked in Mumbai and came back home only on festivals.
, 
, “No one knows what these men do when they are far away, living alone. We counsel youth and men when they leave Fatehpur for work. The stand taken by the women of the village is laudable,” said village pradhan Dharam Raj.
, 
, Elders who work in Mumbai also keep an eye on the younger men. “Instead of staying on the streets, we get together and pool in money to rent common rooms. This has minimized men visiting commercial sex workers,” said ,, who has been working in Mumbai since 1999.
, 
, Social organisations working in HIV prevention in the village are also helping empower women. President of Nehru Yuva Sangathan, Rajendra Sahu said: “Women are better change-makers than anyone else. An aware woman force in the village has checked the rate of new cases in the past few years.”

This is the centre she has been visiting for tests for three years; she also received her medicines from the hospital here. Now, her future hangs in balance. , 	“I don’t know how I will manage my treatment now. I had a proper place to stay at and healthy food to eat whenever I went to Dehradun. We want the chief minister to come forward and support the only community centre that was supportive of HIV/AIDS patients,” Antaral told TOI. , 	Many other children with little support from society or families found help at this centre. The cash-starved centre has now received no help from the state government either, despite the very commendable service it has rendered. , 	The community centre was established in 2009 under the aegis of National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), to provide free residential facilities and nutritional food to people living with HIV/AIDS, including women and children. About 2000 patients avail the facility annually. The centre was run by the Agnes Kunj Society (AKS). , 	In just this financial year, over 370 people have visited the centre; half of these were children. , 	The state government holds the Centre responsible for the shutting down of this facility, as it drew funds from NACO. Officials at AKS, who manage the facility, said the expenses incurred at the centre are just about Rs18 lakh per year – a sum the state government should not find so hard to shell out. , 	Neera Kumari (27), an HIV-positive woman, has been travelling for the past five years from Chamoli (275 km from Dehradun) with her husband, who is also HIV-positive. The couple would get their medicines from here before returning home. , 	“This was one place where we did not feel discriminated against. We were not alone here – there were about 15 couples we would meet once in a while who availed the services. The health department needs to think about getting another facility opened, if this must shut. Either open up AIDS medicine or test centres in each block or get us a proper community centre like AKS,” Kumari said. , 	Kailash Joshi, who works as head of administration at the health directorate, told TOI, “There is nothing to be done. We are trying to get things working. I cannot say much, I joined this post only recently.” , 	Officials had met the chief minister in this matter on November 23, but no resolution was found. Meanwhile, patients complain that although the chief minister and the health officials talk of providing free transport and social security numbers, there is little help forthcoming when they actually need help. , 	Lawrence Singh, project coordinator at Agnes Kunj Society, said, “We tried to offer the best services possible. Now, even our resources have run out. Our centre was used not only by local people but also residents of neighbouring states like UP and Himachal. It would be nice if the health department understood the condition of patients not accepted in their own families and society. We had so many patients come here for a place to stay and get good food. They came for treatment and counselling, and some were really small children.” , "

Agricultural labourers and housewives were among the majority to be infected, highlighting the need for strengthening the HIV programme, which is going through a severe fund crunch.
 
, An analysis by the Maharashtra State , Control Society (,) found that young people contributed to 42% fresh infections, while 6% were adolescents. It showed that 28,925 people tested positive for HIV out of the 21.37 lakh tested. Despite a constant decline in new infections across the state, young adults and adolescents, particularly in rural pockets, continue to be the most vulnerable due to lack of adequate knowledge or access to it.
, 
, Women accounted for 56% new infections, while it was 43% among men and 1% in the transgender community. But the trend in Mumbai is the opposite, where most infections are still seen in men, and only 36% are detected in women. The study showed how education played a pivotal role in an individual getting the infection. About 29% who contracted the virus were illiterate and 35% had primary education. The graph dropped to 28% among those who completed secondary education and to 8% for those with college degrees and above.
, 
, Infectious disease consultant Dr Om Srivastava said people in their early teens and pre-20s are the most vulnerable due to limited access to information or resources. “There is an element of irresponsibility for those beyond 20-22 as they have access to funds, resources and information,” he said. Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (,) president Dr Sagar Mundada said pre-marital testing should be promoted on a larger scale.
, 
, The highest infection (42%) was detected in the 36-50 age group. Incidentally, a year-on-year increase in this age group has been noted in Kolhapur. HIV in the 51-60 age group stood at 8% and among senior citizens 3%. Dr Shobhna Tehra of MSACS said, “The disease is well under control. Our testing has doubled and infections have halved.” Fresh infections have declined by 45% over the last five years in the city. Among the newly-infected, 78% are aged 15-49, said Dr Shrikala Acharya, additional project director, Mumbai District Aids Control Society (,). Around 93% of the infections were due to unsafe sex.
, 
, But an expert said, “The cloud of uncertainty has to be cleared from the programme that is struggling with demotivated workers and high attrition.” The MSACS has received only Rs 11.89 crore for the year despite having an approved budget of Rs 104.73 crore from the National Aids Control Organisation (,).

" and ,Updated: Nov 30, 2015, 04:35 IST,Even as experts flagged the point that HIV has been on the wane, a major victory in 29 years, they warned that... ","HIV cases dip, high-risk groups still a worry","MUMBAI: When , is observed across the globe on December 1, India will enter the third, and perhaps the most perplexing decade of its ,. 

, The first 29 years were marked with victory as the , (,) metamorphosed from being the deadliest word in public health to just another chronic disease such as diabetes or hypertension. that can be managed well with medicines. But experts warn that complacency, accompanied by a sharp drop in funding, could prove to be costly for India. 
,
, Consider Mumbai for instance. HIV among the city's general population fell from 3.6% in 2013-14 to 3% in 2014-15.But the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) that manages health programmes for HIV+ AIDS people has been managing with a third of its annual budget of Rs 25 crore. ""Medicines have had a marvellous effect on the HIVAIDS epidemic so far. Every patient who has managed to get these medicines has not done poorly But we could head for big trouble if patients don't adhere to drugs or fail to get it in time,"" said infectious diseases specialist Dr George Oomen. The country has faced a stockout of HIV drugs in the past few years.
, 
, Indeed, while year-on-year, incidence of new infection among the general population and pregnant women has shown a significant decline, that among risk groups continues to be a cause for concern. As per the HIV sentinel surveillance data of 2010-11, HIV among female sex workers in the city was around 6%, way higher than the national prevalence of 2.7%.
, 
, 
, 
,
, However, the main sentiment on the eve of World AIDS Day is of positivity. ""What is the difference between HIV in 1985 and 2015? HIV+ people don't really frighten others anymore,"" said Ashok Row Kavi of Humsafar Trust, one of the first organisations started in the country to advocate for rights of men who have sex with men (MSM). ""People are living a prolonged life with antiretroviral therapy (ART),"" he said. Our biggest achievement is that we have killed the fear."" Dr Shrikala Acharya, additional project director, MDACS, said, ""We have come from a stage when HIV prevalence in Kamathipura was 54.3% in 2003. Today, the awareness is massive and everyone knows about ways of prevention."" 
,
, Mumbai currently has over 30,000 people living with the disease. A senior NGO member , who worked with FSWs in Kamathipura, said the disease is no longer a death sentence. ""We probably don't even know how many women must have died of AIDS. It is a rare thing today."" But a doctor said the Indian program faces problems that government officials aren't ready to accept. so far. 
,
, ""Less than a tenth of those who need second -line HIV drugs access them under the government programme. These patients will not only develop further resistance but even spread the disease in the community,"" hes aid. He added the happy picture could crumble in a few years at the rate it's progressing. ""The Centre has washed it hands of funding , programmes and states haven't realised their importance."" 
"
" and ,Nov 30, 2015, 05:39 IST",`Drugs for all HIV patients not feasible',"The , (,) has made it clear that India is not ready to adhere to WHO's recent recommendation of providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all HIV patients regardless of their disease stage. 

, Till now, in India, only those with a CD4 cell count of less than 350 are started under the ART programme. The NACO, for the first time in over a decade, has decided that the lifesaving antiretroviral drugs will now be offered to even those with a slightly higher CD4 count of 500. CD4 cell count is a crucial marker of how aggressively the virus is destroying the body's immune system. “We have to look into the evidence of starting ART for all. More than evidence, it is operational feasibility, finances, human resource and how the ART centres will cope with the increased load of more patients,“ said Dr BB Rewari, national programme officer (ART), NACO. On WHO's recommendations, he said the guidelines are never meant to be adopted immediately . “It is expected to take a year or two,“ he said. 
,
, With the tweaking of CD4 requirement, over 2-3lakh HIV patients, who earlier did not qu alify for the free ART therapy are likely to be brought under its ambit. Currently , only 8 lakh people in the country are on the ART programme, even though the total number of people li ving with HIV in India is esti mated to be 21lakh. 
,
, Physicians firmly believe that the way forward is early initiation of ART in all adults, , adolescents and children with HIV . Dr George Oomen, infec tious diseases specialist, said there is ample evidence to show that people who have started ART at their highest CD4 count, be it 750 or 1,000, do best. 
,
, Head of medicine at Parel's KEM Hospital Dr AR Pazare reiterated, “That is the way world is treating HIV . Why wait for the person to become too sick or for his CD4 count to fall so much?“ He said early ART can not only stop progression of disease but also cut down on transmission. 
,
, Parallel to the CD4 debate is that of providing oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent acquisition of HIV. Ashok Row Kavi of Humsafar trust, that works with men having sex with men, said PrEP has been in use in India for the last few years, but its inclusion in national programme may not be a reality soon. “There is an ideological debate on whether to provide ART to gay men as a preventive drug or first reach out to all women and kids,“ he added. Rewari said PrEp is being tried as a pilot study among female sex workers in Chennai, Mysore and Kolkata.

The donors were tested and Daisy’s blood turned out to be HIV positive. “I was clueless about how I got infected until I saw my husband’s medical report at our home in Vellore. He was sick. And one day he told me that he was HIV positive. It was the most shocking moment in my life,” she said. , 	Worse, Daisy’s husband even spoiled her plan to return to Oman in many ways. He threatened her and tore her passport. But Daisy managed to go back to Oman with a new passport. Her husband reacted furiously by writing to the management of the hospital where she worked. The management asked her to undergo one more test, and unfortunately that too turned out to be positive. , 	As she was getting ready for her return, she got a telegram. “It said my husband was no more, but it was too late.

This means, the total number of essential medicines, prices of which are capped by the central government, would increase from 348 to 384, including diagnostic agents and contraceptives. The move following recommendations from a core committee formed by the health ministry is expected to make many important drugs affordable or at least reduce their prices significantly to bring relief to patients.
, 
, Calling it the “best fit list”, the core committee under the chairmanship of former Indian Council of Medical Research chief VM Katoch said emphasis was laid on the disease-burden and treatment guidelines as basis for selecting, and therefore, medicines which are “aligned with the current treatment guide lines“ and those used for treatment of diseases that are “public health problems“ have been added to the new list. The new list of essential medicines, which comes into effect immediately, will be revised every three years as per the committee’s recommendations.

, The Technical Research Group (TRG) has recently recommended community based screening using whole blood finger prick tests in population that has remained unaddressed. The TRG has also recommended testing in existing targeted intervention sites, community based screening through health camp approach for truckers and migrants, and provider initiated testing and counseling for pregnant women and TB patients. The NACO has also accepted the WHO's recommendation of using ancillary health care providers, including peer counsellors, for conducting HIV screening after adequate training. 
,
, Other recommendations of TRG include acceptance of pre-test information instead of pre-test counseling and verbal consent in order to decrease the time and inconvenience for the testing and counseling procedure. The age of consent for HIV testing has also been recommended to be reduced to 16 instead of 18 to enhance early diagnosis. 
,
, ""AIDS Healthcare Foundation has been a front-runner in the advocacy for community based testing globally for more than eight years and has conducted more than 7 million tests globally in the past two years. AHF, through its implementing partner in India, India Cares, has conducted more than 220000 tests and identified more than 1900 unreached people living with HIV/AIDS in India,"" said Dr Nochiketa Mohanty, country program manager, AHF India. 
,
, ""HIV testing must be scaled up in a big way around the world. Governments need to embrace community-based streamlined testing models that use rapid testing technologies and make testing free, convenient, hassle-free and easily accessible, particularly for the most affected populations. Testing results should be available the same day and there needs to be strong linkage to care and services for those who test HIV-positive,"" said Terri Ford, AHF chief of global advocacy and policy.

The survey findings were released to the media on Friday.,The state's mining and industrial pockets areas continue to record high prevalence of HIV cases despite numerous government intervention schemes.,The findings, which are based on screening camps and integrated counseling and testing centres (ICTC) in 23 districts (excluding Garhwa), have recorded 1,496 positive cases in the past year. Of them, around 1,035 cases have been documented in the five districts. ,Ranchi has recorded 264 new cases, while Dhanbad has witnessed 114. East Singbhum district, including Jamshedpur, has recorded 188 new cases. Giridih has recorded 125 new HIV cases while Palamu has 132. However, Hazaribag has the most number of cases with 344 new infections in 2015. The survey is based on the screening of at least 1.07 lakh people, including priority groups such as sex workers, truck drivers and migrant workers, JSACS said. ,Dr Shami Akhtar, state programme officer for intervention in JSACS, said the number of new cases have recorded a marginal fall (0.02%) from 2014-15. During 2014-15, 1,645 new HIV infections were reported statewide. While Ranchi recorded 315 new infections during that period, Hazaribag remained the most affected with 463 positive cases out of 17,000 people screened. ,While the body attributed most of the new infections to migrant workers who were screened on their return home during festivals, JSACS suspects a larger number of unidentified HIV patients. ""The numbers can be anywhere between 30,000 to 36, 000 people,"" Akhtar said. According to National Aids Control Organization (NACO) statistics of 2013-14, Jharkhand has over 18,000 HIV positive patients. ""Migration is an issue which is beyond our control.

,""There will be a significant shortfall in the funding needed for HIV control in sub-Saharan Africa in the coming years and those countries with the highest HIV burden will be unable to meet their obligations on their own to sustain control efforts,"" according to researchers at ,.
, 
,India too has many issues with medication and finances for HIV control programmes; many patient groups throughout 2015 complained out drug stockouts that resulted in the most vulnerable patients not getting their medicines continuously as prescribed.
, 
,In a research paper that appeared in the , on Sunday, the researchers calculated that the price tag for providing long-term HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment in 2015-2050 in the nine sub-Saharan countries most affected by the epidemic ranges from $98 billion at current coverage levels to $261 billion if coverage is scaled up.
, 
,""The HIV epidemic is far from over,"" said first author Rifat Atun, professor of global health systems, in a press release sent by the school of public health. ""The magnitude of funding needed to sustain the HIV fight is very large and the consequences of complacency even larger.""
, 
,Atun and colleagues looked at the nine countries that account for 70% of the HIV burden in Africa—Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. ""They modeled these countries’ HIV/AIDS funding needs through 2050, based on four different scenarios of coverage levels, using data from Spectrum, a publicly available tool used by UNAIDS,"" said the release.
, 
, The researchers say that ‘front-loading’ investments now will be necessary to ensure that higher levels of coverage are achieved. This would ultimately reduce HIV transmission and future funding obligations.
, 
,Domestic financing, the most important source of funding for HIV, will not be sufficient to meet future obligations, so new, innovative sources of funding will be necessary to both maintain and expand treatment and prevention.
, 
,""The problem of predictable and sustainable funding must be resolved,"" said Atun, noting in the paper that, ""There is an ethical responsibility to continue financing for those receiving ART, and not abandon them to death.""

, This assumes significance as the AIDS control programme, which is on the verge of maturing from receiving international ,, suffered a huge cut in budgetary allocation last year. This led to shortage of condoms, medicines and testing kits across the country. In fact some states also sacked healthcare workers involved with the programme blaming it on financial crunch.
, 
, However, this year's budget has proposed an allocation of Rs 1,615 crore for the programme, as compared to Rs 1,300 crore under the revised estimates of 2015-16.

, ""We are taking a holistic approach. Therefore, we have now covered over 1 lakh patients for third-line treatment. We have also raised the bar for CD4 count for those who will be eligible for free treatment,“ health minister , said.
, 
, Currently, anyone who has a CD4 cell count of 350, and consequently, a very high viral load, is eligible for free ARTs. Under the new plan, which will be implemented from April, patients below 500 CD4 count will get free ARTs. This is in line with the guidelines from World Health Organisation (WHO), which recommends free ARTs for all HIV patients.
, 
, According to a senior official, the increase in coverage of patients for free ARTs alone would entail an investment of around Rs 75-80 crore. Besides, the plan to introduce third-line treatment is estimated to be worth Rs 11crore.

Their system includes a guide RNA that specifically locates HIV-1 DNA in the T-cell genome, and a nuclease enzyme, which cuts the strands of T-cell DNA. Once the nuclease has edited out the HIV-1 DNA sequence, the loose ends of the genome are reunited by the cel''s own DNA repair machinery.,Researchers focused on infected CD4+ T cells to show that the technology eliminates the virus from cells and also its persistent presence in HIV-1-eradicated cells protects them against reinfection. , The researchers carried their work over to ex vivo experiments, in which T-cells from patients infected with HIV were grown in cell culture, showing that treatment with the gene editing system can suppress viral replication and reduce viral load in patient cells.

JSACS authorities said the decision to seek external comes after the re-filling of condom vending machines in high risk areas was stopped after the suppliers ended their agreement with National Aids Control Organization (NACO) in 2014. The halt in supplies forced JSACS to remove the vending machines from 50 spots in urban pockets and high priority areas in mining districts. ""The subsidized condom distribution programme cannot kick off in the state unless other measures are taken,"" a JSACS officer said. ,JSACS has sought help under the funds allocated for the corporate social responsibility activities and will approach the companies to distribute condoms among these vulnerable groups at subsidized rates and help organize regular screening to detect new positive cases. This comes at a time when as many as 16,905 people are living with HIV disease in the state and new infections are on the rise. ,""A large number of HIV positive cases are hidden from our knowledge because they have not got themselves screened. The population mostly comprises of migrant workers and truckers and can infect thousands more,"" said Shami Akhtar, state programme officer of JSACS. ,The data collected by JSACS through various screening camps across 24 districts show that at least 1,500 people contracted infections in 2015. The numbers are higher in industrial and mining districts of East Singbhum, Dhanbad, Giridih, Seraikela-Kharsawan and Hazaribag. Besides condoms, the JSACS will also approach the industrial houses for contributing to the awareness campaigns in the high priority areas. "

Presently out of every three cases detected, one is a female compared to one in eight or 10, a few years ago. ,Recent data released by Goa State AIDS Control Society (GSACS), nearly 31.2 % of the infected females belong to the age group of 15-34 as compared to about 36.7 % infected males who belonged to this age group in 2015.,While infection through blood and blood products and infected syringes and needles is negligible, sexual route is the predominant mode of transmission and it ranged between 83 to 95% followed by mother-to-child transmission at 4 to 8 %.,Dr Vanda Viegas, senior physician posted at Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre at Goa medical college (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, attributes the relative rise in HIV infection among females to a pattern, which she says is obvious. While earlier the rate of infection was predominantly high among men who have sex with men (MSM), the focus now is on women. And this is hardly surprising with sexual route being the main route of transmission in the state, she says.,Viegas, who is exposed to a varied number of HIV/AIDS cases, said of late, she has observed HIV infection among some widows as well. Most of these women got the infection from their husbands. ,Inquiries revealed that husbands of these women died around seven-ten years ago of tuberculosis, which is an opportunistic infection that persons having HIV/AIDS virus get. ,""These women never got tested for HIV infection after the death of their husband,"" says Viegas. They are now coming for testing, when the virus has become dominant in their body.,The GSACS data reveal that in 2013, proportion of females among the sero-positive cases was 42.1% whereas in 2015, proportion of females among the sero-positive cases was 45.5 %.,HIV is prevalent in all parts of the state, and the majority of the cases are reported from the four coastal talukas, Mormugao, and Salcete in South Goa, and Bardez and Tiswadi in North Goa."

Out of this, 1.5% of the cases were due to intravenous usage.,So rampant have been the cases that chief minister Tarun Gogoi recently expressed concern over the menace and even asked the chief secretary to constitute a 'task force' headed by the additional chief secretary.,IDU groups are categorised as high risk groups (HRGs) among other HRGs like 'men having sex with men' (MSM) and 'female sex workers' (FSW).

"May 16, 2016, 06:46 IST",Budget cut for NACO hits HIV/AIDS control programme,"Visakhapatnam: HIV/AIDS counsellors have not undergone training in the last two years. Reason? There is severe fund crunch with the government curtailing the budget. The only centre in AP for training counsellors is at the psychology department of AU.,AP State Aids Control Society (APSACS) sources said due to 20% cut in the annual budget for the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), officials could not take up the mandatory training sessions for the district level counsellors. For the years 2014 to 2016, the budget has been cut from Rs 1,700 crore to Rs 1,300 crore. This has affected the HIV/AIDS control programme. A portion of the fund is diverted to Swachh Bharat and skill development programmes.,Earlier, the training centre for counsellors used to get funds from abroad routed through the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) under the global fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria project. But after the stipulated eight-year period of funding was over, there was no money to continue the project. Project director and head of the of AU psychology department Prof MVR Raju said, ""We used to train counsellors every three months, with around 30 counsellors in each batch. Each ART or HIV treatment centre in the state is supposed to have counsellors for patients and there are more than 700 such counsellors in the state. But since the last two years, we didn't receive any funding from APSACS. The HIV/AIDS control programme is not being given much importance in the last two years. Not only for this project, but for other educational projects too, we find the funds not forthcoming and on enquiry find that part of UGC funds gets diverted for skill development and Swachh Bharat."",Even the State AIDS Control Society officials admitted to the shortage of funds for the last two years and reduction in NACO budget. A SACS official said, ""The new government doesn't encourage international donors like UNICEF and global funds and NACO had to undergo a budget cut in 2014-16 period of Rs 400 crore. The various SACS used to get funds directly from NACO but even that was discontinued and SACS had to get them through government treasury. Every time, there would be a delay of 4-5 months."",""However, the treasury system was removed this year and again we are directly getting funds from NACO and after all the states had complained about the budget cut, the allocation for NACO has been raised to its earlier Rs 1,700 crore from this fiscal. But due to the 20% cut in the last two years, we were unable to give salaries, organise capacity building, training programmes and workshops all over India and the overall HIV/AIDS control programme had been hit,"" added the SACS official."

"May 28, 2016, 10:15 IST",Russian activists struggle to raise HIV awareness as epidemic grows,"MOSCOW: , stunned hundreds of students at a conference in Moscow last week when he reached into his pocket and took out a condom.

,""And you, the young generation, how do you protect yourselves from HIV?"" said Pokrovsky, the 61-year-old head of Russia's federal , centre.
,
,""I always have a condom on me. Today even a 90-year-old can contract the virus.""
,
,The audience fell silent for a moment before breaking into applause.
,
,Despite the efforts of activists like Pokrovsky, the total number of registered HIV cases in Russia exceeded one million in late 2015, with authorities struggling to contain an epidemic that experts say could be curbed by increased funding and more awareness campaigns.
,
,Pokrovsky has been openly critical of the Kremlin's policies promoting traditional family values, saying they have failed to halt the spread of the deadly virus.
,""In 2015 alone, some 100,000 new HIV cases were reported in Russia,"" Pokrovsky told AFP.
,
,""This is a very high rate, maybe the highest in Europe.""
,
,The Russian government's policy focuses on treatment while neglecting prevention drives such as sex education in schools, with the number of people infected with the virus soaring as a result, say experts.
,
,A public health campaign in Moscow last year urged people to be faithful to their partners, rather than promoting condom use.
,
,""Young people here often don't even know what HIV is and don't understand its dangers,"" said Moscow-based student Darya Belimova who joined Pokrovsky to address more than a thousand young people at the conference.
,
,The gathering was part of the ""Stop HIV/AIDS"" prevention campaign spanning more than 200 universities.
,
,Although the Russian health and education ministries support ""Stop HIV/AIDS"", activists and volunteers say they are fighting a lonely battle against Russia's , as the virus increasingly affects the heterosexual population.
,
,The World Health Organization last year said that Russia accounted for 60 percent of all HIV diagnoses in Europe in 2014, with heterosexual sex the main route of transmission of the virus which is spread through contact with contaminated body fluids.
,
,The number of HIV-positive minors which stood at 9,792 in 2015 has also jumped 8.5 percent compared to the previous year.
,
,In most of these cases an HIV-positive mother transmitted the virus to the child at birth, said Pokrovsky.
,
,""In Russia, there is not enough public financing to support the fight against HIV at a national scale, and HIV prevention programmes for drug addicts practically don't exist,"" he said.
,
,There are just a few dozen NGOs working to fight the epidemic, spread across 40 Russian cities.
,
,""For Russia, this is a very small number,"" Pokrovsky said.
,
,Organizations like the Andrey Rylkov Foundation which runs an outreach programme for drug users in Moscow, handing out clean needles and condoms receive no government funding.
,
,The vast size of the country also presents a challenge for effective prevention, with far-flung corners of the federation like Siberia particularly badly affected.
,
,Russia also bans methadone replacement therapy for drug addicts, which would allow users to avoid injections, eliminating the risk of contracting the virus from contaminated syringes.
,
,Many Russian NGOs, including those working on HIV prevention among drug addicts, have been under increased pressure since the reelection of President Vladimir Putin to a third term in 2012.
,
,Shortly after he was sworn in once again, the government passed a law allowing authorities to brand groups engaging in broadly-defined ""political activity"" that receive foreign funding as ""foreign agents"".
,
,The legislation was passed soon after huge anti-Putin protests rocked Moscow, and Kremlin critics see the law as a way to muzzle the strongman's critics and tighten his grip on power.
,

The forum had demanded that the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) should provide the free medicines and perform the required tests without any fees in February at the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre set up at the Savitribai Phule General Hospital. ,According to the civic officials, the ART centre, which was set up in 2013 has since been providing health care to 3,500 patients with HIV. Patients have to undergo various tests before being shifted to the ART treatment regime. The forum, in its letter to the KMC, stated that private hospitals charge anything from Rs 500 to Rs 600 for every test and the total cost of these tests can amount to thousands, which is not affordable for many. HIV is detected through multiple blood tests.,V K Suryawanshi, the co-ordinator of ART centre at Savitribai hospital said, ""Once the patient is detected with the presence of HIV, then he or she has to take medicines and undergo regular check-ups life long. We are going to take the help of the forum to get a maximum number patients to ART. The medicines will be provided for free and the pre-ART tests will also done free of any cost. We want poor patients to benefit from the facility."", ""We have decided to improve the infrastructure for the ART centre. The stock of the medicines has also been increased as we expect a rise in the number of patients,"" added Suryawanshi."
"Updated: Jun 2, 2016, 10:12 IST,PCR could be a more accurate test for HIV, says NIRRH consultant (btrenkel/Getty Images)","PCR could be a more accurate test for HIV, says NIRRH consultant","Amid concerns of , transmission through infected blood, a premier research institute in the city has revealed that they came across two rare cases where the most commonly used HIV ,, ELISA, could not detect the virus for up to two years. The finding assumes significance as most blood banks, hospitals and transfusion centres use , as a , standard to detect HIV.
 The virus in the two city women could finally be detected using the , that is occasionally used to test HIV. The Parel-based National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (NIRRH) had come across the cases in 2012, when the women were referred from JJ Hospital with a history of co-infection. 
,
, The revelation comes within days of the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) stating that 2,234 people have contracted HIV across the country through transfusion of infected blood in the past one-and-a-half years. In Maharashtra, 276 people have got HIV through infected blood. 
,
, The point here is not to say that ELISA is unreliable but that there is a possibility of missing out infected bility of missing out infected cases. In both cases, the antibodies did not appear for two years,“ said Dr Atmaram Bandivadekar, consultant at NIRRH. HIV antibodies are generated by the body's immune system when under attack from the virus. Tests like ELISA check for the presence of antibodies to say if a person is infected or not. 
,
, “Different individuals can take varying time to generate antibodies, but two years is too long,“ he said. Bandivadekar said that PCR could be a more accurate alternative. “This test finds either the RNA of the HIV virus or the HIV DNA in cells infected with the virus. The test can be done within days of exposure as one does not have to worry about the window period,“ he added. In an ELISA test, there is a window period of one to three months depending on whether the technology is from the first or fourth generation. 
,
, The husbands of both these women were HIV positive and were taking the antiretro viral therapy at JJ Hospital.Doctors at the hospital became curious when the women frequently came with some ailment despite repeatedly testing negative for HIV . 
,
, They stopped following up with the institute after two years. 
,
, But staunch ELISA supporters are not willing to write off the test yet. “It has been proved beyond doubt that this test has a low chance of giving a false result after the first few weeks that a person is infected.The world over, it is the first line of screening. If ELISA is negative, other tests are not usually repeated,“ said a microbiologist. Though if ELISA comes positive, the test is repeated to confirm the findings.“PCR may be reliable but it is expensive and needs expertise,“ the doctor added. 
,
, Bandivadekar felt all blood banks should have the PCR technology. Dr Shrikala Acharya, additional project director of the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (,), said there are cost and operational issues that have to be considered. An ELISA test in a private lab costs up to Rs 650, whereas a PCR test may cost over Rs 2,500.

A petition moved by V S Ugrappa, chairman of the expert committee on preventing sexual violence against women and children, has set the ball rolling with the police taking up the case.,The complaint was filed recently at Sadashivnagar police station against the hospital, a gynaecologist, and two employees of the Integrated Counselling and Testing Center for cognisable offence of ""forgery with medical records and medical negligence"".,""It is submitted that the accused hospital is involved in gross medical negligence by causing HIV infection via contaminated blood transfusion. Thereafter, the accused have tampered with the medical records to cover up the crime. The chain of events shows that within all human probability, the offence of forgery of medical records to conceal evidence of medical negligence. This complaint may be specially taken in record and speedily acted upon, because of the gravity of the crime, the maneuvers of the other side to hush up matters and cause great harm to me and my family,'' the complaint has stated.,The major offences recorded are: Forgery of medical record (IPC section 466); cheating (420); forgery (463), making a false document (464). Subsequently, the police have taken up an FIR and investigations are on -- they are examining the medical records and have questioned the hospital staff and the doctor.,Documents show that on February 13, 2014, Gowri was admitted to the hospital and discharged on the 15th. Her discharge summary says that her Hb% is 7.5m, platelet count 2.29; VDRL, HIV I & II negative and one unit of blood transfusion was advised. Accordingly, on the 14th, one unit (300 ml of RBC) was given (blood unit number 17093 for which the family has the record) and on the 15th she was discharged and asked to come back on the 19th.,Subsequently, on February 19, Gowri was again admitted and the same set of blood tests were carried out. And this time the results were: Hb% 10.2, platelet count 2.23 and HIV I & II negative (in fact it is very unclear and looks like a scribble). The discharge summary read: ""Patient came with the above mentioned complaints, diagnosed to be Retro Positive and counseling done. Hence discharged on February 22.'' Surprisingly, the blood unit number was changed to 12093 in the hospital records.,The patient gave another sample for testing at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Center on February 24 which also showed her positive for HIV. Intriguingly, the same Center has another record to show that on February 12, Gowri's sample was tested and came back HIV positive. But the catch is that Gowri was admitted to MS Ramaiah only on February 13, hence where did this blood test come from. The family sees something amiss., ,""This is a fraudulent document. When my sister was admitted on 13th and her blood sample drawn for testing at MS Ramaiah, why would she go for blood tests on the 12th? This document was created subsequently to show that the patient was infected before she was admitted. But the hospital's first discharge summary says that the blood tests are negative for HIV. This has to be investigated thoroughly,'' said the patient's husband Rajanna (name changed).,MS Ramaiah Hospital termed the issue an ""allegation"" and its chief administrator Dr V Narendranath, who did not want to divulge much on the case, said, ""It is in court and it is sub judice. We will respond to the court and give a reply to the appropriate authority. We respect our patients and we cannot divulge the patient's medical history. We will not breach the patient's confidentiality at any cost."" Expressing his resentment over the police ""harassing the doctors and para-medical staff for four days"", Dr Narendranath says: ""Why is this a criminal case? These days, hospitals have become a soft target. Every patient has a right to express his/her grievance and somebody has to decide what is right and what is wrong."" ,For a start, MS Ramaiah Hospital doesn't come under the state government's Individual Donor Nucleic Acid Testing (ID-NAT) project where blood is tested at the highest standard. The normal process followed for testing of donated blood in private blood banks in hospitals is the Elisa test, which detects Hepatitis B and C and HIV for antigens and antibodies. However, under ID-NAT, the blood sample is tested for HIV, HBV (Hepatitis B) and HCV (Hepatitis C) to detect direct Ribo Nucleic Acid and DNA of the virus. All government hospital bloodbanks and Rotary-TTK are a part of this project where donated blood is mandatorily tested by ID-NAT. This test is done at Bowring Hospital, the only certified blood testing facility.,According to specialists, a virus, after entering the bloodstream, has a window period and only after that can the antigens or antibodies be detected. HIV has a lower window period than HBV or HCV -- around 15-20 days. In case an HIV-infected person donates blood and the window period is just four to five days, the virus will go undetected and there is a fair chance that it could infect the person undergoing the blood transfusion."

The patient, a 45-year-old man from northeast, has been living with HIV since 2003. He contracted Hepatitis C leading to , failure. 

,The family of the patient said the local hospitals they approached had given up, saying there was no cure for this complex condition. So, they rushed him to Delhi where the transplant was carried out.
,
,“It took us over 10 hours to carry out the life-saving procedure. We had to be very careful not to catch the infection. At the same time, we had to ensure that the patient didn’t contract any infection post transplant,” said Dr Naimish Mehta, senior liver transplant surgeon at SGRH. 
,
,He said HIV patients are generally not taken up for major surgeries, particularly transplants, because they are immune-compromised. 
,
,“In this case, for example, the patient had both HIV and Hepatitis C, which compromised his immunity significantly. Additionally, we had to suppress his immune system post transplant to ensure that the body doesn’t reject the new liver,” Mehta said.
,
, The liver transplant surgeon added that this was a huge challenge for them and any misstep could have proved fatal.
,
,The liver transplant surgeon said both the donor and the recipient were doing well. 
,
,In India, 2.1 million people are living with HIV and Hepatitis C virus co-infection, said Dr Anil Arora, chairman, department of gastroenterology at the hospital.
,
, He added that initially HIV infection was considered an absolute contraindication for organ transplants because of concerns about disease progression. 
,
,However, with recent advances in retro-viral therapy for HIV and treatment for Hepatitis C virus infection, complex procedures, including transplants, can be carried out, the doctor added.
,
,The US Congress recently passed HIV Organ Policy Equity Act (HOPE Act), which allows organ donation between HIV positive individuals. 
,
,“The prevalence of liver disease in patients with HIV is higher than that of the general population, as are the morbidity and mortality. But with successful transplant, it is possible to give them a new life,” Arora added.
,
,According to the doctor, in India, the biggest hurdle for patients suffering from HIV is the stigma associated with this disease.
,
, In many areas, HIV positive people are considered social outcasts. Worse, they are turned away by many hospitals too. “In spite of medical advances, these patients find themselves condemned for life,” said another senior doctor at Gangaram hospital.

"Updated: Jul 28, 2016, 11:26 IST,A recent study published in The Lancet journal stated that viral hepatitis deaths increased by 63 per cent in ... ",Hepatitis: A disease that's deadlier than HIV,"We all know enough about HIV yet it remains one of the most dreaded diseases across the globe; yet another HIV-like disease, which is a time bomb waiting to explode goes unnoticed by many. Introducing Hepatitis, a viral infection that affects the liver and is a leading cause of death and disability across the world. The disease is backed by some startling facts. A recent study published in The Lancet journal stated that viral , deaths increased by 63 per cent in the last 23 years.
 
, For the uninitiated, there are five different types of viral hepatitis, namely A, B, C, D and E. All of them are contagious and some are life threatening too. Hepatitis A and E are waterborne; Hepatitis B, C and D are transmitted by bodily fluids (via syringes, needles, injections, toothbrush, razors). Furthermore, all of them are contagious and some are life threatening too.
, 
, Dr. Ajay P Choksi, Consultant and Head, Dept. of Gastroenterology & Hepatology at Nanavati Super Speciality Hospital, Mumbai explains, ""Hepatitis A and E are generally self limiting and don't normally last beyond six months. However, they can be severe, incapacitating and fatal during this period. Hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HBC), on the other hand, can give rise to acute illnesses like A (HBA) and E (HBE) but can also cause chronic liver disease, which can lead to cirrhosis of liver or even cancer of liver. Hepatitis D (HBD) infection occurs only if a person has Hepatitis B.""
, 
, Shockingly, there have been a surge in deaths in the past 20 years. ""Despite alarming statistics, we as a country have not undertaken enough clinical research. Of the five, there is no cure for three of them. Hepatitis C alone affects estimated 12 million people in India, most of whom don't even know they are carriers. The combined burden of viral hepatitis is huge in India. We need treatment regimens that are short and therapies that are effective, affordable and well-tolerated,"" shares Suneela Thatte, President, Indian Society of Clinical Research (ISCR).
, 
, , has stated that a shocking 95 per cent of people infected with Hepatitis B or C do not even know they are infected and often live without symptoms for a long time. This year alone, 10 to 30 million people will be infected with HBV. Dr Harshwardhan Dongre, K J Somaiya Hospital warns, ""Currently there is no treatment for acute Hepatitis B infection. Progression to chronic disease depends on a host of factors, so preventing acute infection is the only preventive measure available."" Dr. PM Bhujang – President, Association of Hospitals adds, ""Acute infection may present as fever, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting fever, abdominal pain, jaundice and dark urine. Chronic hepatitis may present with early and late symptoms of liver dysfunction and failure.""
, 
, Unlike Hepatitis B, C and D, Hepatitis A and E do not damage the liver in the long term. ""Once infected or vaccinated, we do not get the infection again,"" adds Dr Vasudevan K R, senior consultant, surgical gastroenterology and liver transplantation department, Jaypee Hospital, Noida.
, 
, 
,
, 
, Most of the viral hepatitis have vaccinations and so the first plan should be to get yourself duly immunized against them. Follow the below guidelines:
, 
, - Avoid sharing sharp objects for example, needles, razor and toothbrush.
, 
, - Avoid unprotected sex.
, 
, - Three dosages of hepatitis B vaccine given at intervals of 0-1-6 months would give immunity against Hepatitis B at more than 95% probability.
, 
, - All infants should be immunised against hepatitis B in 1st year of life.
, 
, - All pregnant ladies should be screened for hepatitis B & C and if found positive, adequate measures should be taken to prevent transmission.
, 
, - No open wound should be contacted without gloves.

,
, Dr. Neeraj Saraf, Associate Director - Hepatology, Medanta - The Medicity lays busts some common myths 
,
, 
,
, 
, 
, Ninety percent of infected adults with acute hepatitis B can recover without any problems, but most infected babies and children eventually develop chronic hepatitis B infection, where recovery is not possible. New antiviral treatments may reduce the incidence of complications by suppressing the virus and preventing progression of the disease. 
,

, 
, The Viral Hepatitis B vaccine is absolutely safe and extremely effective. It only takes 3 shots to protect against viral hepatitis B.

,Principal health secretary Sujata Saunik said that the National Centre for Disease Control in 2014 had designed guidelines for safe injection practices, which the state has decided to adopt now.
,
,“The first step would be to transition from disposable to single use auto-disable syringes in the immunization programme so that any likelihood of , reuse is ruled out,” Saunik said on the sidelines of a WHO event on Hepatitis Day on Thursday. “It will be complemented by extensive awareness about birth vaccination, training of healthcare workers on handling and maintenance of drugs and safe disposal of syringes. Timing of the vaccination is also of utmost importance.”
,
,Unsafe injection practices such as reuse of syringes and needles is a leading cause of transmission of blood-borne pathogens such as hepatitis B, C and HIV. Transfusion of unsafe , is another route through which these infect people. It is estimated that over 1.15lakh people die of hepatitis B related complications every year in the country.

"Updated: Jul 29, 2016, 09:55 IST,74% male sex workers in Chennai at risk of HIV: Study (Jamie Lords/Getty Images)",74% male sex workers in Chennai at risk of HIV: Study,"They are told their orientation is unnatural, their profession criminal and their existence precarious yet outreach programmes for them are minimal. Although male , (MSWs) come under the high-risk category under , intervention programmes, their names rarely make it to the list. The result is more than 25 years after the initiation of the country's AIDS control programme, most of them continue to engage in unsafe sex.
 
, A , by a group of researchers from institutes across the world, including the , (NIRT), Chennai, has found that 74.2% of the MSWs they surveyed accepted more money from their clients to not use a condom. The study, recently published in AIDS Care, took into account experiences of 100 , around the age of 25 years in the city. Beena Thomas, an , scientist, who was part of the research, said at least three-fourth of the subjects surveyed expressed difficulty in convincing their clients to use condoms. “They find it hard to negotiate. And if sex work is their only source of income, it is likely that they agree to go forward without protection as the clients pay more,“ she said. The subjects said they earned between `2,000 and `8,000 a month.
, 
, Although male sex workers are at a higher risk of contracting HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STI), they remain understudied compared to their female peers. Experts attribute this to the stigma attached not just to sex work, but their sexual orientation as well.
, 
, The study also noted that only 64% of them reported ever testing for HIV. Dr Sundar Sundararaman, a physician who has worked with HIV patients for the past 30 years, isn't surprised by these figures. He said while HIV intervention programmes have listed transgender, women sex workers and homosexual men under the high-risk category, they are yet to recognize male sex workers as an exclusive group. “Male sex workers are not identified and so they aren't in the ambit of service delivery ,“ he said, advocating changes at the policy level. He said financial incentives for riskier sexual behaviour, coupled with lack of access to prevention services, increased prevalence of HIV and STIs among MSWs compared to broader population of men having sex with men. The study also noted that more than half of the subjects did not know the HIV status of their most recent client.
, 
, As believed, it is not just women sex workers who face abuse. Researchers found 60% of the MSWs faced verbal abuse and 40% were physically assaulted. Those who financially depended only on sex work were far more vulnerable and likely to report abuse.
, 
, Dr Vijaya Raman of Tamil Nadu AIDS Initiative said the numbers were alarming and urgent steps needed to be taken for intervention programmes to reach this group. “Our outreach programmes need to be revamped. This is an evolving sector. Previously , they operated in groups, now many of them work individually through the internet, which gives them anonymity,“ he said.
, 
, The study threw another surprise highlighting the need to identify this group -nearly 72% said they wanted to continue sex work. “This being the case, HIV prevention interventions shouldn't try to draw MSWs away but focus on facilitating skills that will support their ability to negotiate sexual safety,“ said Thomas.

"Updated: Sep 1, 2016, 11:57 IST,Dearth of infrastructure and manpower at blood banks are additional challenges.",85 turn HIV+ due to blood transfusion in last 3 years,"Mumbai's , control body, in an RTI, has revealed that 85 people were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) while getting , in the last three years. The numbers, though based on voluntary disclosure of clients visiting , testing centres, have raised serious concerns about safety and testing protocols at blood banks in the city.
 
, The RTI response by the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) shows that 18 got HIV through infected blood in 2015-16. The infections more than doubled (42) in 2014-15. In 2013-14, 25 infections were attributed to blood transfusion.The disclosure came as the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) claimed that transfusion-transmitted infections are largely restricted to rural areas with limited medical infrastructure.
, 
, Government agencies fighting HIV in the city are clueless about the source of the untested blood. “We were told there is no mechanism to trace the source of the infected blood or find out which bank supplied it.It is a worrying situation,“ said Chetan Kothari, who filed the RTI. The numbers were collated from integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC) at all major public hospitals of the city. MDACS said only a miniscule percentage of HIV , in the city are caused by infected blood. “The heterosexual route is still responsible for more than 90% infections. Out of the 8,000odd cases detected in the city annually, only 0.02% is attributable to blood transfusion,“ said Dr Shrikala Acharya, additional project director, MDACS.
, 
, Activists, however, felt blood banks have a major role to play. “As per rules, when a donor turns out to be HIV positive, heshe must be informed and referred to the centres. But most blood banks don't do it,“ said an employee of a leading blood bank who has been advocating safe blood. He insisted the blood donor, unaware of his status, continues to donate blood. “If he is within the 3-6month window, the ELISA test used to check blood in most banks won't be able to detect the virus,“ he said.
, 
, Therefore, a huge emphasis should be on pre-donor counselling. “A detailed history of the donor before blood donation, where they are asked open questions about their lifestyles, can significantly bring down infection. But, unfortunately, at most blood camps, it is looked at as a waste of time,“ said Dr Zarine Bharucha, chairperson, Federation of Bombay Blood Banks (FBBB).
, 
, Dearth of infrastructure and manpower at blood banks are additional challenges. A pathologist told TOI there is a staff shortage at most banks. “Blood is not tested for days or there is shortage of kits. This can lead to false negativity or positivity,“ the doctor said.

"Sep 17, 2016, 15:43 IST",Fear of having HIV among the most common phobias in Kolkata,"KOLKATA: A technician’s fatal fall to escape an Alsatian has opened up the discussion on the different kinds of phobias that Kolkatans are suffering from. While fear of dogs, lizards and mathematics are very common, city-based psychiatrists admit to coming across more extreme and sometimes weird cases. From homophobia to scare of having ,, from worry over not having mobile connectivity to fear of being touched – a large number of Kolkatans are experiencing all of these and even more. Some are even tweaking around with their lifestyle to deal with their fear.

,A very common , that doctors have reported is the fear of having HIV. A small cut in a salon is enough to trigger it. Some of these patients don’t just live with the fear. They even go to the extent of getting HIV tests done. Sometimes, the tests are done repeatedly. Dissatisfied with repeated negative HIV tests, general physicians then refer them to psychiatrists. “They live with this fear despite having done the tests. Some also have similar phobia about having swine flu,” said psychiatrist Dr Jairanjan Ram.
,
,Psychiatrist Dr Abir Mukherjee has also come across this phobia. Mukherjee makes a distinction between obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and phobia. According to him persons with OCD experience persistent recurrent intrusive thoughts that might result in them avoiding imaginary situations. They might see a drop of blood on the floor and imagine that somehow they will have HIV from it. “In case of phobia, the person exercises caution in behaviour and might display a tendency to avoid real situations. He might not visit a parlour for fear of ‘contacting’ HIV,” Mukherjee explained, also mentioning cases of patients suffering from fear of mosquito bites and earthquakes.
,
,The increasing depending on mobile phones has led to the rise of nomophobia or the fear of no mobile connectivity because of network or battery charge issues. An investment banker from this city recently cut short his four-day vacation for river rafting because there was no mobile connectivity. Anil Punjabi, chairman (east) of the Travel Agents’ Federation of India, has noticed how this fear among tourists has had them change their travel plans. “Recently parents didn’t give permission to their children to go out camping to a place where there was no mobile connectivity.” Fear of not having WiFi has also gone up.
,
,Adding to this list is the pathological fear of contamination and germs or mysophobia. Psychologist , came across a patient who just didn’t want to touch the doorknobs. “She would wait for someone to offer assistance to help her open the doors. She is undergoing cognitive behavioural therapy to overcome this,” she said.
,
,Fear of being touched or haphephobia is an issue with many teenagers. “This often occurs when a child has a history of sexual abuse. I remember a teenager who had turned violent. After some sessions, I found that his violent behaviour was his defence mechanism because he feared anyone touching him. So even a pat on his back was problematic. Later it was detected that as a child his parent would get violent with him and those memories had an impact on his behavioural patterns,” Singh said, adding that she has also come across cases of necrophobia or the fear of losing a dear one to death.
,
,Fear of taking flights is common among Kolkatans. Mukherjee recalls a top executive who had come for counselling because he just couldn’t go for air travel. He even missed out on promotions because he couldn’t go for overseas trip. After graded exposure and systematic desensitization, he was able to overcome the fear, fly overseas and get his promotion too. “Agoraphobia is also common,” said Mukherjee. It is an anxiety disorder characterized by symptoms of anxiety in situations where the person perceives the environment to be unsafe with no easy way to get away. “The problem can be so acute that they even fear to go anywhere alone,” Mukherjee added.
,
,Homophobia, psychiatrists insist, is also quite common. “Because of this fear, some have even approached me with strange requests to conduct tests to ascertain if they are bisexual or homosexual,” Ram said.
,
,But what is even more curious in this city is that many closet homosexuals also display this homophobia. Choreographer , remembers one incident at a party where a much-married man was openly abusing homosexuals. “Much later, when I interacted with him on a one-on-one basis, he started flirting with me. Being macho in front of the world was his defence mechanism to announce that he isn’t gay,” Chakraborty said. According to Chakraborty, at least 60 per cent of gay men in Kolkata live dual lives and many among them are homophobes too in public.

,
,The 44-year-old is the first of 50 people to complete a trial of the ambitious treatment, designed by scientists and doctors from five of Britain's leading universities - universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial College London, University College London and King's College London.

,
,It is this aspect of HIV activity that is targeted and suppressed by anti-retroviral therapies (ART). What ART cannot do is pick out the millions of infected T-cells lying dormant around the body -- but waiting to spring into life should ART fail. It is the HIV reservoir in these dormant cells that the research group is targeting.
,
,""It would be great if a cure has happened. My last blood test was a couple of weeks ago and there is no detectable virus. However, that could be the anti-retroviral therapies, so we have to wait to be sure,"" the London-based patient said.
,
,The new trial is being backed by the UK's state-funded , (NHS) because it could save millions by removing the need to treat HIV patients with ART, which costs around 380,000 pounds per person over their lifetime.

"Oct 3, 2016, 16:03 IST",Child sex abuse in men ups HIV-risk behaviour later in life,"CHENNAI: Men who were sexually abused by other men when they were children are prone to initiating same-sex encounters, says a study. This puts them at greater risk of ,.

,The study, undertaken by a team from Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, covered 11,700 men who have sex with men (MSM) in 12 districts, including Chennai. It found that close to 23% of gender non-conforming boys were victimised by older trusted men, which pushed them to engage in HIV-risk behaviour later in life. 
,
,Epidemiologist Sunil Solomon, who was part of the research, said when the team set out to study the burden of HIV among MSM, several participants they surveyed shared their sexual experiences as children. “What troubled us was that many of them described it as experience, not realizing they were survivors of abuse. They thought it was natural, which only further marginalized them,” said Solomon.
,
,A kothi (effeminate man) in Chennai recalled his uncle molesting him when he was three. “I didn't know what he was doing,” the study quoted him as saying. Later in life, he tested positive for HIV. 
,
,“I didn't tell anyone what happened to me. When they (his family) scold me (for having HIV), I want to say `You should have taken care when I was young. I am alone now'.” 
,
,
, 
,
,According to official estimates, men who have sex with men have a 12-14 times higher prevalence of HIV than other men.
,
,The study found that the prevalence of child sexual abuse was higher among ""gender non-conforming men"" than the general population, which also increased their vulnerability to HIV.
,
,They found that those who had a history of abuse had approximately 2.5 times more lifetime male sexual partners compared to those without and the HIV prevalence was almost double in the former group.
,
,Child sexual abuse in general has been identified as an important predictor of high-risk sexual behaviour later in life for both men and women, including early sexual debut, unprotected sex, multiple partners, and engagement in transactional sex, which increases the risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.
,
,A study by UNICEF, covering 13 states, found that more than half of children (53%) reported abuse, with the prevalence being higher for boys than girls (53% and 23% respectively).
,
,The study found the prevalence of child sexual abuse among the group to be the highest in Tamil Nadu where 43.2% of the participants claimed they were sexually abused, with Coimbatore having the highest at 70.2%. In Chennai, 34.3% said they were abused. Experts say the prevalence is probably high in the south because of better reporting.
,
,Child rights and LGBT activists say the study has highlighted the need for more intervention programmes for boys who have been victims of abuse.
,
,“While abuse is generally high among children, the prevalence is exceptionally high among gender nonconforming boys. They are already grappling with being different from how the society describes their gender. Abuse just makes things tougher,“ said Dr L Ramakrishnan, country director, SAATHI, an organisation that works on HIV/AIDS.

The therapy is combining standard antiretroviral drugs with another one that reactivates dormant HIV and a vaccine that induces the immune system to destroy the infected cells. Antiretoviral drugs alone are highly effective at stopping the virus from reproducing but do not eradicate the disease, so must be taken for life.
,
,The 44-year-old Briton is the first among 50 people to complete a trial of the treatment, designed by scientists and doctors from Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial College, University College London and King's College. Early tests show no signs of the virus in his blood, the Sunday Times reported. If successful, it offers hope of an irreversible cure for millions of people infected with the virus.
,
,But the person will have to wait for some months before confirmation on whether the treatment has permanently cleared the disease. It is possible that the absence of the virus could be down to the conventional drugs that he has also been taking which can temporarily clear the body of the disease. “My last blood test was a couple of weeks ago and there is no detectable virus,“ the patient said.
,
,HIV is able to hide from the immune system in dormant cells where sophisticated testing cannot find it, and therefore resist therapy . The treatment endeavours to trick the virus into emerging from its hiding places and then trigger the body's immune system to recognise it and attack it, an approach that has been called “kick and kill“. The new therapy works in two stages. Firstly ,a vaccine helps the body recognise the HIV-infected cells so it can clear them out. Secondly, a new drug called Vorinostat activates the dormant Tcells so they can be spotted by the immune system.

,
,""With sexual activity being one of the primary methods of HIV transmission, it is necessary to try to protect those parts of the body that are most likely to encounter the virus first,"" said Branka Grubor-Bauk, from the University of Adelaide in Australia.
,
,""A possible reason why previous HIV vaccine trials have not been successful is because of this lack of a frontline protection,"" Grubor-Bauk said.
,
,The laboratory studies, conducted so far in mice represent an important step forward in attempts to introduce a first line of defence against HIV at the site of infection.

,
,Plagued by many doubts - Will my children get HIV? What if I get weaker and cannot work? Anand is not alone, there are many like him who want such questions answered. Coming to their rescue are a host of startups, which offer hope and promises to improve the manageability of such conditions.
,
,Online pharmacists are proving useful to such patients, who have chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, HIV, asthma, cancer as buying online has its plus points like bulk orders, discounts of 15%-20% to manage their daily dependence on drugs.
,
,But for patients with HIV, it helps them overcome social stigma, as their purchases remain a secret.
,
,“There is no human interface, which is a huge comfort factor to some people. We cater to many remote villages in India and people can order in bulk for three-five months and a discreet package arrives at their doorsteps. We also send out refill reminders two-three weeks ahead of time,” Pradeep Dadha, CEO, Netmeds, which got $50 million in funding from a group of investors, including US-based investment firm OrbiMed and MAPE Advisory. .

According to a study by , (NACO), between January 2015 and May 2016, 127 patients in the , due to inappropriate blood transfusion.

,Out of 184 licensed blood banks in the state, only 66 are NACO certified for safe blood. Going by the report, Uttar Pradesh tops the list with 371 HIV positive cases triggered through blood transfusion, followed by Gujarat (292), Maharashtra (276), New Delhi (264) and West Bengal (135).
,
,Officials at Indian Foundation for Safe Blood (IFSB), an organization that works towards creating awareness about diseases transmitted during blood transfusions, said: “Globally, 15 % of HIV is transmitted through blood transfusions and in India the rate is extremely alarming. In the past five years, 9,000 people in India got affected by HIV due to blood transfusion. In Chhattisgarh blood transfusion has become a major carrier of AIDS. In Jodhpur, 53 kids were tested positive for Hepatitis C after receiving infected blood. Although better than five other states, Karnataka still doesn’t look safe.” Blood transfused without proper checks could result in deadly infections like HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Malaria, Syphilis, Dengue and Chikungunya.
,
,Explaining the reasons behind random collection of blood, IFSB officials added: “Often, shortage of blood leads to unhealthy ways of collecting it. Another problem is non-availability of the exact blood group. Also, only a very small percentage of blood is collected through repeat voluntary blood donors, who are the safest donors. Most of the others are first-time donors who are more likely to transmit infections as they aren’t tested in advance. Further, majority of blood is collected through mass blood donation camps which lack proper facilities for screening.”
,
,Asked about ways to tackle the problem, another source from IFSB said, “The method of testing needs to improve. The Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) method should be used to detect HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. NAT is conducted in two ways --- Mini Pool Nucleic Acid Testing and Individual Donor Nucleic Acid Testing (ID NAT). In the first one, blood samples are pooled together for the purpose of testing. However, there’s a disadvantage. Even if one sample contains a virus, the entire batch has to be discarded and each sample tested individually all over again. ID NAT is the best method as it captures the virus itself. Increase in voluntary repeat blood donation, pre-donation health history screening and hemovigilance programme are other ways to address the issue.” 
,
,ID NAT method
,
,ID NAT is a conventional method of testing blood. It requires the presence of antibodies to trigger a positive test result. ID NAT is used to detect the low levels of viral genetic material present in the body. However, it happens before the body begins producing antibodies in response to a virus, enabling detection of a disease early. This method significantly reduces the time between donor exposure to the virus and the appearance of antibodies. This way, it allows for earlier detection of the infection and thereby reduces the possibility of transmission via transfusion. 
,
,Pvt hospitals to blame 
,
,According to NACO data, of the 66 NACO-assisted blood banks in Karnataka, 40 are in the government sector and 26 are in NGOs, charitable and voluntary sector, without a single one in the private hospital sector. IFBS officials say Karnataka has already taken steps to curb transmission of infection through blood transfusion and that it’s the only state government in the country to have made ID NAT mandatory in all government blood banks and hospitals. However, this crucial blood safety technique hasn’t been widely adopted by private hospitals in the state.

,
,“When he came, the boy’s immune system was weak and infections were high. I realized that HIV infection could flare up during the transplant. That was the biggest challenge for us. The whole process, including preparing the boy for the surgery, took several weeks.

,
, Sachin’s HIV infection is now under control and he no longer needs any blood transfusion, he added.
,
,It may be too early to predict, given that the transplant took place just five months ago. But if the boy doesn’t show further symptoms of HIV relapse in the next one year, this procedure can be considered as a possible cure for HIV. There’s no need to worry about HIV transmission between the bone marrow donor and the recipient; the donor is at no risk of contracting HIV in the process. Sachin’s six-year-old brother, the bone marrow donor in this case, is completely healthy

The programme was organised to encourage the children to fight against the disease. Over 15,000 adults (both men and women) are registered with this centre, out of whom 6,000 make regular visit to take medicines. She said that BHU ART centre is one of the 10 centres of excellence in HIV care in the country and lone in , and ,. Besides being the tertiary centre to provide second and third line drugs, the BHU ART is also a research and training centre.

,
,In 2015, around 3,600 pregnant women were given the treatment.
,
,“Mother-to-child transmission is the most common way for children to get HIV infection. Notably, children under 15 years of age accounted for 6.54% of the total HIV infected population in India. In most of these cases, the disease was transmitted through parents during birth,“ said infectious disease expert Milind Kulkarni. Today, it is possible to prevent perinatal HIV with effective and sustained use of medica tion.
,
,“Most pe ople in India are unaware of this fact but an HIV posi tive mother can give birth to a disease-free child. A number of countries inclu ding Thailand have succeeded in completely eliminating this mode of transmission of HIVAIDS,“ said Kulkarni.
,
,He has extensively worked in various research projects of , (NARI).
,
,Since HIV is transmitted through blood and blood-related products, transmission from an infected mother to her child can occur at any time during pregnancy.
,
,“Putting infected expectant mothers on antiretroviral therapy as soon as pregnancy is confirmed is an essential intervention. At birth, the baby is also given a six-week therapy to combat the threat.This protocol can successfully prevent mother-tochild transmission in most cases. Since breastfeeding can also transmit the HIV virus, infants born to infected mothers are recommended formula milk as a safe alternative to breast milk,“ he explained.
,
,Kulkarni said, “If an infected woman strictly follows HIV medication, and ensures her baby receives the required HIV medication for the initial six weeks, the risk of transmission reduces to less than five per cent.“

,
,NAAT, which was approved for use in 2002 by the FDA, can detect HIV infections in blood donors earlier than other screening tests because it detects viral genes rather than antibodies or antigens. 
,
,The appearance of antibodies, which happens after an infected donor's immune system responds to the virus, requires time. Similarly, detection of antigens also requires time as it needs a higher level of virus to appear in the bloodstream. In both cases, a 'window period' is created during which a donor can be infected but test negative for HIV.

, The Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART), given free at ART centres of the Goa State AIDS Control Society (GSACS), is a big succour for persons living HIV, but counsellors and doctors say that counselling them is tough. The level of depression among adolescents and youth is so acute that some have lost their spirit of optimism.
, 
, An official said HIV-positive youth and teenagers are more likely to lead a depressed life if they have no family support. Sadly, in the case of most of the youth, family ties are missing with one or both parents long dead. The majority are brought up in orphanages. A few are looked after by their extended families.
, 
, ,, 23, who was raised in an orphanage since birth — his parents had left him in the hospital after his HIV status came to light — has grown so pessimistic that he refuses to believe that anything positive will happen in his life. The ART staff try to boost his morale by telling him about the research under way to invent new drugs to improve quality of life of persons living with HIV, but Akash’s hopes are long lost.
, 
, “Akash doesn’t even want to consider a possibility that better drugs that can cure HIV will be invented. He is certain that HIV will not leave him till his death,” a counsellor said.

, ,, 19, a class XII student, has failed to keep pace with studies. He went into depression after he started developing severe side effects of ART. “Due to the illness he has not been able to concentrate. His mother’s second marriage has further upset him. We have advised him to complete his education through correspondence courses,” the official said pointing out that having to lead life without family support increases the probability of depression.
, 
, “Once they turn 18, they have nowhere to go. ART lengthens lives and improves quality of life. But, now, the bigger question before them is how to lead a normal life, and that, too, all alone,” he said and added that there has to be some backup plan to enable HIV-positive persons in the reproductive age group to lead a healthy life.
, 
, For the last few months, Shivanand Azrekar, 25, has been going through bouts of depression. , is married and has one child and every time he visits the ART centre, the first question he asks the staff is, “how much time do I have?” Despite being put on ART, Azrekar’s condition is deteriorating, the official said.

,While donors in the city welcomed the move, they were concerned about two things: cost and whether it is a ploy by private companies to sell their NAT kit. “Studies have shown that NAT is better than Elisa.Government hospitals have to introduce NAT to popularise it,“ said Jishnu Raj, coordinator, Blood Donors, Kerala.While Elisa test costs around Rs 400, NAT costs Rs 800.
,
,Both Elisa and NAT are used to determine if a person has antibodies related to certain infectious conditions. However, there is the issue of window period. Window period is the length of time after infection during which a test has a higher chance of incorrectly reporting the absence of disease (false negative). The window period for antibody tests can range from 3 weeks to 6 months.
,
,“Nucleic acid tests typically have shorter window periods, and this means that they can be used more reliably , particularly in cases where the exact point of infection isn't entirely clear,“ said Dr Narayanan.
,
,NAT was first introduced between 1999 and 2001 in blood banks across France, Germany , Italy, Spain, Switzerland and the ,. Studies showed that countries that introduced NAT have en countered a decrease in residual risk of viral transmissions. Although, other safety measures such as more stringent selection of blood donors have contributed as well; a marked decrease is evident.
,
,The residual risk for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission prior to NAT was 0.64 cases per million in France and 3.94 per million in Spain which decreased to 0.1 per million and 2.33 per million respectively after NAT was adopted.HIV NAT yield rates were estimated at 0.3 per million donations in France and Spain as opposed to 0.59 and 2.48 respectively preceding NAT.
,
,IMA's move is crucial as India has the second-highest pool of HIV persons estimated at 5.7 million and 3-5% HBV and 1-2% HCV cases reported among a population of almost 1.2 billion. Post-transfusion prevalence of hepatitis has been observed at 1-1.8% for hepatitis B and 0.28-0.5% for hepatitis C and 0.23-0.47 for HIV.
,
,“To ensure that blood banks and hospitals shift to NAT, we will soon be conducting a training session for doctors,“ added Dr Narayanan.

The situation is no better in Karnataka, with only 21% of the , and 33% of the infected female sex workers undergoing anti-retroviral therapy, according to the , (KSAPS).

,Ahead of World AIDS Day on December 1 (Thursday), TOI found that of the 6,756 HIV-infected female sex workers in the state, only 2,257 are benefitting from anti-retroviral therapy. Similarly, of the 175 transgenders with HIV, only 37 are being treated. This despite the HIV Bill introduced in 2014 — it was amended this year — which makes anti-retroviral therapy (it can enhance longevity) a legal right for all HIV patients.
,
,“A recent study conducted by Swasti for the , revealed that often doctors refuse to treat individuals from the transgender community. They are either ignored or are shown the door by doctors, who say they don’t know how to treat them,” said ,, director, Avahan – Swasti, a health resource centre that works with the transgender community, sex workers and gay men. The study covered transgenders in five states — Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, UP, Gujarat and Maharashtra.
,
,The study showed that even transgenders are hesitant about getting themselves tested for HIV, though hospitals provide the facility. “There is an assumption that only those who are sexually active or sexually promiscuous need to get the test done. Transgenders are judged not only by hospital staff but also their peers,” she added.
,
,Highlighting the distress of female sex workers, thoracic surgeon and director of , and Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases, Dr Shashidhar Buggi, said: “We cannot expect others to stop discriminating against sex workers if the doctor community itself is biased. The harsh reality is despite being aware of the nature of HIV virus, the medical fraternity often chooses not to treat an infected patient. The stigma is even more deep-rooted when the patient happens to be a sex worker.”
,
,Stating that numbers don’t depict the real picture, Dr Buggi explained: “The existence of prevention societies is not enough to bring about a positive change in the health condition of sex workers, as the ground reality is different from what’s there on paper. There is no proper retrieving system in place, with no one to assess the work of these organizations and question their accountability. Most of the cases these organizations record are under-reported.” 
,
,Demonetization a hindrance
,
,The recent demonetization policy has only added to the plight of transgenders as far as treatment is concerned. “It has become very difficult to meet medical and travel expenses. I recently had to undergo a uterus operation, which was an expensive procedure. The tests and follow-up visits have drilled a hole in my pocket and scrapping of the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has only made it worse,” said Usha, an HIV positive transgender.
,
,Manta, another transgender who’s a sex worker, said: “I am HIV positive but I have learnt to take care of my health. However, after demonetization, my income has drastically reduced. Either the clients don’t pay or they hand over high denomination notes. Either way, I am left with no money.”
,
,Social hierarchy a barrier 
,
,Another study on transgenders revealed that social hierarchical systems play a major role in deciding which healthcare services an individual can access. Every decision vests with the guru. The study found that 12.3% of the community members opted for informal surgeries conducted by someone from the community or the guru as opposed to formal services provided in hospitals. Any transgender who goes against the guru has to face discrimination

This, despite doctors working hard to eliminate , transmission from mother to child. Approximately, a third of these women are pregnant. 

,According to the latest statistics, over 3,000 women in Gurugram did not undergo HIV tests till October 2016. Of this, 1,215 pregnant women had been counselled to do so. Till October, 14 cases of pregnant women having HIV have been confirmed. 
,
,According to doctors, it is possible to eliminate transmission, but only if mothers agree to get tested.
,
,Dr Himanshu Batra, head of the department of paediatrics at Columbia Asia hospital said, HIV testing is a part of routine screening at all private hospitals. “All of my patients get tested for HIV, no matter what,” he said. It is not the case everywhere, though. 
,
,In 2015, 7,700 men were counselled at government-run integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC), and 6,660 men opted to get tested for HIV. The number is higher in the case of women, where 21,562 women underwent counselling last year, but only 18,449 opted for testing. The gap is 3,113 women. In 2014, this number was 1,600, in 2013, it was 1,005 and in 2012 it was 899. 
,
,According to Vijay Kumar, the nodal district officer of the , programme run by the ,, there are many reasons behind the figures.
,
,“Some of them don’t get tested because they don’t want to wait for the long hours of testing (it takes around two hours for an HIV test). Others think they are not at much risk, and therefore drop out of the tests. We cannot force them as it is done only with their consent,” he said.
,
,HIV infection can be caused through various means: sexual transmission, blood transfusion, intravenous drug use and from mother to child. However, 90% of children with HIV contract it from their parents.
,
,According to doctors, a complete cure is possible if detection is early. 
,
,According to , (,), its ‘Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission’ services cover only about 47% annual estimated pregnancies in India. In 2015-16, 12.7 million pregnant women accessed this service.
,
,A NACO report says the number of women who are counselled anyway covers only 47% of women, making the number of women who do not get tested significantly large. “In such a situation, complete elimination of HIV transmission from mother-to-child appears to be a distant possibility,” it reads.

This year’s theme ‘Hands up for HIV prevention’ focussed on prevention of spreading HIV infections, discrimination and AIDS related deaths. 

,“The total number of people living with HIV in India was estimated to be around 2.1 million in 2015. Notably, children under 15 years of age accounted for 6.54 per cent of the total HIV infected population in India, a bulk of them having been transmitted the disease from their parents at birth. Eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV-AIDS is the next major challenge for India, the risk of which can be successfully minimised or even eliminated with effective and sustained use of medication,” said Dr P Haranath, dermatologist from Bhavya Skin Care Centre, Vizag. 
,
,As per NACO Technical Estimate Report (2015), out of an estimated 29 million annual pregnancies in India, about 35,255 occur in HIV positive pregnant women. This data postulates that in the absence of any intervention, over 10,000 babies infected with HIV are being born every year. According to ,, without any intervention, transmission rates range from 15 per cent to 45 per cent.
,
,“Putting infected expectant mothers on anti-retroviral therapy as soon as pregnancy is discovered is an essential intervention. At birth, the baby is also put on a brief six-week therapy to combat the threat. This protocol can successfully prevent mother-to-child transmission in most cases,” he said. 
,
,Relentless awareness campaigns and successful use of anti-retroviral therapy has helped India reduce the burden of HIV/AIDS prevalence steadily over the past two decades. India’s new infections were estimated to be at 86,000 in 2015, showing a marked decline by 66% as compared to the year 2000.

The sole NGO, which is currently working with the MSM (men who have sex with men) population, is involved in a number of programmes, but others say not enough is being done to cover a large migrant population in the city that is potential risk for people in other states.

,According to Srikant of , (SOSVA), the only active NGO currently working among the MSM population, there is a large migrant population and female sex workers who are currently not made aware of HIV/AIDS at the ground level. “The migrant population changes every six to seven months, so there is a constant requirement to raise awareness among them. The risk of HIV is not only limited to them, but also extends to their wives and families when they go back home,” Srikant says.

,“The new system, followed after recommendation from the ,, is in place across all ART centers in India,” said Prof AK Tripathi, head of haematology department, King George’s Medical University that runs UP’s biggest ART center, talking to TOI on World , Day here on Thursday.
,
,CD4 count is the estimation of white blood cells in a person’s body. It shows how fit a person’s natural defence system is to fight pathogens, infections and illnesses. While the CD4 count of a healthy person is anything between 500 and 1,500, the count of an HIV-infected person tends to drop below the normal. 
,
,Since the launch of the National HIV AIDS Control programme in India, it has been the basis for starting ART treatment. Earlier, a person with CD4 of 250 or less was put on ART medicines. This was later revised to 350 to benefit more patients. 
,
,Those with CD4 count above the range were considered ‘healthy’ and had to wait for their condition to deteriorate for the treatment to start. However, HIV-positive pregnant women, children, people with TB or history of TB or hepatitis B, C and discordant couples were excluded. 
,
,In 2013, WHO called for a revision of the benchmark and pressed for starting ART even if CD4 count was around the normal range of 500. “It based the move on a number of sub-Saharan, South American and American studies which showed better survival and quality of life if ART was started at CD4 count of 500,” he explained.

"Mihika Basu,Updated: Dec 26, 2016, 10:07 IST",Scientists proffer new method to weaken HIV,"Though the , (AIDS) can be controlled with a cocktail of ,, the disease, caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV, does not have a permanent cure as yet. The treatment of AIDS, however, has got a major boost with , from Bengaluru reporting in a study that if the mutation rate of HIV virus is increased by two to six times, it could become ineffective against its host/human body in 10 years. Lead researcher Narendra Dixit, however, cautions that by increasing the mutation rate, such a person will not get cured, but their findings reveal how long it will take for the virus to become non-infectious, and the disease non-progressive.

,Some of these drugs to increase the mutation levels are already undergoing clinical trials. According to the researchers, a major advantage of these drugs is that they are not susceptible to drug resistance. Hence, Dixit, who is an associate professor at Department of Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, said that in the coming years, with better drug combinations, the treatment window could be reduced further. Their findings have been reported in “Physical Biology” journal.
,
,Scientists have so far failed in their efforts to find a permanent cure as HIV virus mutates or changes rapidly, thus making drugs and potential vaccines ineffective. This implies that by the time a drug tries to make the virus ineffective, another mutant that is resistant to the drug, has already developed. Hence, this latest finding is important because it establishes that a threshold level exists for HIV and the virus loses its potency level if its mutation rate is increased by over six times its current or natural mutation rate.
,
,“One reason why researchers have not been successful in their endeavour to find a permanent cure for , is because of the high rate at which the virus mutates, causing it to overcome the selection pressures imposed by drugs and potential vaccines. From the virus’s point of view, however, there is a flipside to having very high mutation rates. If it increases beyond a tipping point, called error threshold, then it leads to low fitness in the virus population, making it an ineffective pathogen,” said Dixit.
,
,Prof Dixit and his team have been studying the process of infection caused by HIV and its evolution using certain computer simulation models in the laboratory, which allow them to closely track the fitness levels of the genetically diverse populations within a host and the factors that contribute to it.
,
,The finding also has implications for how we treat AIDS, said the research team. High mutation rates can be induced in HIV using a special class of anti-retroviral drugs. If the mutation rate can be raised to the error threshold, then, in principle, the virus can be prevented from causing progressive infection. This research shows that, in fact, such a benign state can be achieved by using mutation-inducing drugs for a period of about 10 years. For their study, the research team used information from the drugs which are currently under trial. They demonstrated in their simulation model that by administering these drugs for 10 years, the replicating HIV will become harmless. This, according to experts, can be an alternative method or strategy to attacking and eventually killing the virus.

"Apr 29, 2017, 06:00 IST",THE NATARAJA WHO MADE PERINI SHIVATANDAVAM HIS LIFE’S PURPOSE,"A dance guru, scholar and musicologist par excellence, late , needs no introduction. How he revived ,, the 700-year-old dance form of Telangana, is stuff of legend. Hailing from a well-to-do family, he thrust aside affluence to pursue his passion — dance. How the legend faced his father’s wrath, discarded his family name, embraced poverty and became one of the most revered dance scholars in the country, makes for a fascinating story.

,He chose dance over family
,
,Born in Bali to Ramamohan Rao and Damayanthi Devi on March 21, 1923, Ramakrishna was the middle child among three siblings. His love for dance began early in life after witnessing a temple dancer 
,perform in his native village as an eight year old. Though his mother was a proficient singer, veena exponent and a poet, his father didn’t approve of his fondness for dance. But young Ramakrishna was adamant. To protect him from his father’s ire, his elder brother Shyamsundar took him away to Sri Kalahasti at the age of 14 and put him under the tutelage of Nayudupeta Rajamma, an old , dancer. He mastered the art that was dying because Devadasi tradition was outlawed.
,When his father found that Ramakrishna had not mended his ways, he was sent back to the Ramakrishna Mutt in Madras to wean him away from dancing. But there again his 
,devotion to dance led Ramakrishna in search of another teacher. He went to Pandanallur to train under Meenakshi Sundaram Pillai, but she had nothing much to offer than the ones he has already mastered. When his father learnt that sending him off to Ramakrishna Mutt did not put dance off his mind, he sent Ramakrishna, now matriculate, to Nagpur for higher education, but there again the determined dancer didn’t stop searching for new avenues to master the art.
,
,How Ramakrishna became , 
,
,But thankfully, Ramakrishna’s virtuosity in dance found a patron in ,, the prince of ,. He was summoned to dance before the prince in a court full of artisans. That performance earned him the epithet, ‘Nataraj’ that went on to become his family name. There is an interesting anecdote about how Nataraja became his adopted family name. “Before he got patronage of the Bhandara zamindar, Ramakrishna’s life was a struggle. He had no place to go, no one to look after. His father who came to see him gave him ample money and asked him to come back home and live in plenty — but he has to leave his dance completely. He left his money on the table. Ramakrishna went to his father the next day and returned the money. His father was so angry that he said that if he were a man, he would never use the family name and never refer to his parents publicly. Ramakrishna obliged his father and never used his family name,” wrote dance critic Prof Sharma in a tribute piece.
,
,The three years he spent in the court of Raja Ganapati Rao Pandya were rewarding. He was revered, honoured and appreciated. But everything looked like a mirage to him. He wanted to go back to his native state and nourish the classical traditions of Andhra that were in dormant state.
,
,He played a stellar role in helping Kuchipudi gain classical status
,
,Ramakrishna is a name synonymous with Perini Shivatandavam, but his contribution to Kuchipudi and Andhra Natyaam cannot be overlooked. After he traced his steps back to his native state, he started working on revial and exposure of Andhra art traditions. “When Kuchipudi was denied classical status, Ramakrishna, the then spokesman of State Sangeet Natak Akademi decided to organise the historic All India Dance Seminar on Kuchipudi and other classical dance traditions of Andhra. Experts from all over India attended the seminar. The effort was also to promote Kuchipudi as the cultural identity of the newly formed state of Andhra,” says Anuradha Jonnalagadda, a Kuchipudi exponent and a disciple of Ramakrishna. Ramakrishna, the convenor of the festival demonstrated the richness of the dance form. This seminar gave Kuchipudi the much deserved national recognition.
,
,Reviving the devadasi tradition
,
,During his stay with Nayudupeta Rajamma, he realised that the abhinaya school is on the verge of extinction. After an extensive research in ancient dance traditions, he started writing on the dance traditions of Andhra. In an effort to revive Andhra’s lasya tradition, he along with Annabathula Buli Venkataratnamma went door-to- door in search of a Devadasi performer who remembered the tradition. He found 16 performers, brought them on one platform and organised a lecture series, Abhinaya Sadassu, in 1970 at Rajahmundry. He didn’t stop at that. He reconstructed oral texts belonging to Agama, Kucheri and Bhagavata traditions and made few of his talented disciples undergo rigorous training of the art. To do away with the stigma of Devadasi system, it was decided that the dance form will be renamed as Andhra Natyam. Ramakrishna was instrumental in its accreditation at the university level.
,
,Stumbling into ‘Prerana’ and giving birth to Perini
,
,“While going through Jayapa Senani’s Nritta Ratnavali, he noticed the mention of a ‘prerana’ dance, performed only by men to invoke Lord Shiva. He did his research on agama texts, re-conceptualised the textual evidence of the dance form from Jayapa Senani’s Bharataarnavam and Nritta Ratnavali, Sarangadeva’s Sangeeta Ratnakara and Sarvanga Bhoopala Yechendra’s ,, studied the temple sculptures of Telangana, along with the his vast knowledge of various dance forms, he revived Prerana as Perini,” says Kala Krishna, another disciple of the Perini revivalist. 
,Ramakrishna emphasised that the dance be performed on music that is in sync with the wartime mood. “He developed a specific style of playing mridangam thatshaped the movement of the dance. Unfortunately we don’t have the mridangam players now. After Dhupam Suryalingam who had equal contribution in revival of Perini, it was his disciple, Balarama Moorthy who used to play the instrument. Now without a mridangam player we perform only on recorded music,” laments Kala Krishna.
,
,Nataraja Ramakrishna—a name not recognised
,Despite his contributions, Ramakrishna did not get the recognition he deserves. Voicing his discontentment Kala Krishna says, “The Telangana government is trying to make Perini the dance form of Telangana. It was incorporated in curriculum as a part of Andhra Natyam, but since the last two months it is being studied as a separate subject. But the government has not bestowed upon him the honours and recognition he deserved. Isn’t it unfair to recognise a work but not the name behind it!”

"Updated: May 5, 2017, 15:22 IST",Insurance a mirage for poor HIV positives,"For 45-year-old Siriyapushpam, a daily wage labourer who earns `100 a day, falling ill costs her dear. The Kodambakkam resident is HIV positive and has to forgo a day’s wage to travel to a , in Tambaram. At times when the prescribed medicine is unavailable at the hospital, she has to buy the same from outside at a steeper price. While a weak immune system and lack of a nutritious diet make Siriyapushpam susceptible to frequent bouts of illnesses, she says meeting the increasing medical expense gets harder for her each time. 

,Siriyapushpam’s case is not isolated. A complete absence of insurance cover against opportunistic infections (infections caused due to a weak immune system), affects more than 21 lakh people living with HIV (PLHIV) across the country, including 1.42 lakh in TN.
,
,It has been more than a month since the HIV and AIDS (Prevention and Control) Act 2014 came into place, but insurers say, they are yet to get guidelines on including such patients in health, life and critical illness segments. The Act protects PLHIV against denial, termination, discontinuation and unfair treatment with regard to employment, educational establishments, healthcare services, residing or renting property, standing for public or private office, and provision of insurance. But without specific instructions, PLHIV in the country remain without cover.
,
,According to ‘India HIV Estimation 2015’ report of National AIDS Control Organisation, there were 21.17 lakh PLHIV, including 86,000 newly infected people in 2015. With the highest prevalence being recorded in Nagaland (1.29%), TN’s prevalence rate (0.27%) was higher than the national average of 0.26%.
,
, 
, 
,
,""I have seen cases where hospitals have refused to conduct surgeries to remove uterine fibroids on HIV positive persons. Others charge two to three times the actual cost to operate. If an insurance scheme is introduced for PLHIV, there would be some regulation,"" Kousalya Periasamy, founder of NGO Positive Women’s Network. 
,
,According to a 2006 UNDP study on the socio-economic impact of HIV and AIDS in India, a person with HIV bears expenses between `25,000 - `30,000 a year. The situation is worse if the earning member in a family is frequently hospitalised.
,
,HIV/AIDS and related complications are excluded from critical insurance covers and insurers say they haven’t received instructions to include it in their policies. Health insurance for groups, however, exists. ""In the group health segment, Cigna TTK offers AIDS/HIV cover up to full sum insured under the global health group policy. It covers Indian locals and expatriates working abroad under one umbrella. This cover is available for employees, dependent spouse and children,"" says Sandeep Patel, CEO and MD, Cigna TTK Health Insurance.
,
,Star Health & Allied Insurance provides group cover under the NetPlus policy where the proposal has to come from NGOs or government agencies. However, expenses for HIV treatment are excluded as are people with low CD4 count.
,
,""Only if companies take the initiative and insure PLHIV for frequent hospitalisations and opportunistic infections can insurance create an impact and gain public trust,"" says Dr S Prakash, senior executive director, Star Health and Allied Insurance. 
,
,Others say the new law is a step in the right direction. ""With more such steps and availability of more data to enable pricing of products, we can look towards greater inclusion,"" says Ashish Mehrotra, MD and CEO, Max Bupa Health Insurance.
,
,But for rural households, 72% of who, according to a 2014 NSSO study, rely on private hospitals for treatment, retail insurance continues to be a dream. Dr Sathish Kumar, country doctor for Solidarity and Action Against HIV Infection in India said cover for PLHIV from lower income groups particularly need attention. Presently, the collective gets such PLHIV enrolled in the Rashtriya , Yojana (RSBY). Under the scheme, PLHIV from BPL families can get free hospitalisation up to ₹30,000 per family per year. 
,
,While increasing medical expenses burn a hole in their pockets, patients say unavailability of medicines at ART (Antiretroviral Therapy) centres forces them to make additional trips to the health centre, which robs them of their day’s income.
,
,Nutrition is another aspect which seems to have been brushed aside. ,, a former programme officer of the state AIDS control programme and consultant (community medicine & infectious disease) at SIMS Hospital says, ""Medicines will work only if PLHIV take nutritious meals,"" adding that the Centre should implement a scheme similar to the mid-day meal for PLHIV.
,
,In December 2013, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) announced that people with HIV or other pre-existing illnesses would need to pay a higher premium for life insurance. It also urged companies to continue insuring individuals who contract HIV after buying the policy. This was two months after it issued draft guidelines asking insurers to provide life cover to HIV/AIDS patients.
,
,A lot remains to be done, especially in health insurance. At present, an individual with critical injuries or illnesses such as paralysis or cancer is more likely to getting insurance cover than an HIV positive patient on ART.

, 
, The medical board has to examine the woman latest by May 6 and place the report by Monday.
, 
, “As we are inclined to think that a woman, who has already become a destitute being sexually assaulted and suffering from a serious medical ailment, not to go through further sufferings.

, 
, When the matter was taken up for hearing, the bench asked advocate Vrinda Grover, appearing for the woman, to ask her whether she was inclined to come to Delhi, to which she replied in the affirmative.
, 
, The apex court said it would not go into the Patna high court order which had held that the medical board’s report has stated that it would be unsafe for the life of the petitioner and there was a compelling responsibility of the state to keep the child alive.
, 
, The high court had said the woman’s pregnancy had crossed the legal embargo of 20 weeks under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 and was unsafe to medically terminate her pregnancy.
, 
, Grover said the high court had failed to appreciate that the woman was 35 years of age and completely fit to make her own reproductive choices without any interference.

, However, it was only after she revealed to the superintendent of the shelter home that the pregnancy was the outcome of rape, she made attempts to have it terminated at the Patna Medical College and Hospital on March 14.
, 
, According to the plea, the hospital refused to admit the woman owing to lack of identity proof.
, 
, To terminate her pregnancy, she approached the high court which constituted a medical board to examine her. The board submitted its report on March 17 which said that termination would involve surgical process which may lead to health complications such as bleeding, anaesthesia hazard and sepsis.
, 
, In her appeal before the apex court, the woman said her father and husband, who have deserted her, in their respective replies before the high court, had conveyed their consent for termination of pregnancy of the petitioner. PTI

,The new act seeks to protect the rights of PLHIV, ensuring there is no discrimination against them in healthcare services, education, employment, public facilities, holding public office, property rights and insurance.
,
,Under the act, hospitals including private will not be permitted to delay surgery or charge different rates for services for PLHIV. “This would amount to discrimination as it imposes a burden on a person based on HIV related grounds,” senior advocate and director of the lawyers collective Anand , said. 
,
,He was delivering a public lecture on demystifying HIV & AIDS (Prevention and Control) Bill 2017 at the International Centre, Goa organised by the Lawyers Collective and Positive People in anticipation of the latter’s 25th anniversary.
,
,In cases of discrimination in healthcare, a PLHIV can first complain to the establishment’s complaints authority to bring the problem to its notice and get it rectified, he says. If this doesn’t work, a PLHIV can approach an ombudsman appointed by the state government under this act to inquire into complaints of discrimination and provision of healthcare services where he/she is expected to pass orders within 24 hours of the receipt of the complaint in medical emergency cases. A state must appoint at least one ombudsman.
,
,There is also no reason why insurance premium should be double for PLHIV, Grover says, pointing out that the denial or unfair treatment in providing insurance also amounts to discrimination, provided this is supported by actuarial studies.
,
,The act also requires that no person be compelled to disclose his HIV status except with his informed consent and if required by a court order where establishments maintaining records of HIV positive persons must adopt data protection measures. 
,
,Grover who fought for the rights of Dominic D’Souza, one of India’s first HIV activists and the first case that went to court more than two-and-a-half decades ago, says this new act originated in D’Souza’s fight. Positive People set up by D’Souza in Goa to work for people infected with HIV completes 25 years this month.
,
"
"Updated: May 6, 2017, 07:55 IST",‘Dominic made me promise that I would work for PLHIV as a lawyer’,"

,Dominic D’souzas’ was the first case on HIV to come to the ,. It was a very tough fight because the stigma surrounding HIV was all pervasive. Moreover, most people did not understand the nature of HIV. Practically, everybody assumed that one could get HIV by mere association with a person living with HIV (PLHIV). If I recall, the arguments took about three days, about two days on my part and nearly three quarters of a day on the part of the government. The judges had to be made to understand not only the legalities, but the nature of HIV as it was then understood.
,
,The case revolved around the Goa Public Health (Amendment) Act, 1985, which permitted the government to mandatorily, without consent, test a person suspected of HIV and on being so found, an individuals’ confidentiality would be breached in addition to possible isolation and incarceration. This is what I called the isolationist law. 
,
,We actually lost the case because the Goa bench of the Bombay High Court upheld the amendment except for a partial ‘reading down’, in that the Court allowed the person who was being tested to show by other tests that the person was indeed not ,. This had a very deleterious effect initially as we thought the isolationist law would take root in India. 
,
,However, Dominic D’souza and I, and other friends and comrades were able to resist the replication of the isolationist law of the Goa model in other parts of the country, which was attempted by the central government. 
,
,In that we were able to create a certain momentum which inured to the benefit of the PLHIV movement. In fact, Dominic D’souza became the first PLHIV activist not only in India, but in the region.
,
,
,
,
,When I met Dominic in his last days in Breach Candy hospital, Mumbai, he virtually, in his usual diplomatic way, extracted a promise from me that I shall work for , as a lawyer.
,
, This ‘tryst with Dominic’ became an obsession with me from 1992-1997, which resulted in the very famous judgement of the Bombay High Court, Mx v. ZY. This landmark judgement, delivered by Justice Tipnis, for the first time provided for the recruitment of PLHIVs in the state sector. Justice Tipnis held that if the person was otherwise qualified (such as having a diploma, degree, etc), was functionally fit and he did not pose a significant risk of transmission to others in the environment, then HIV could not be the basis of any discrimination from him being recruited in the public sector.
,
,
,
,
,The success in the MX v. ZY in 1997 put Lawyers Collective’s HIV work on the map such that a lot of gay people started coming to our office. On looking at the situation of gay men the conclusion was inevitable that Sextion 377 of the IPC was a cause of a lot of gay men’s woes in terms of law. 
,
,This persuaded us to mount a challenge to 377, which was ultimately done in the Delhi high court successfully in 2011, but unfortunately we faced defeat in the Supreme Court, in 2013. The curative petition is still pending in the Supreme Court.
,
,
, 
,
,Indeed, Dominic D’souza’s case was the first of many, which laid the roadmap of the now HIV Act. The HIV Act contains what we argued in Dominic D’souza’s case in Goa, such as, no testing without informed consent (Section 5), no discrimination or isolation (Section 3) and no breach of confidentiality (Section 8).
,
,
,
,India has come a long way in treating PLHIV. However, there is a long way to go. We have to remember that India is the pharmacy of the developing and, partly, of the developed world. From 2000 onwards HIV ART triple combination therapy was supplied by India generic companies around the world, though this therapy ART was available from 1996 onwards in the West.
,
, However, we were able to supply that in India from the government sector only in 2004, despite the fact that it was Indian generic companies who were supplying ART to the rest of the developing world. Earlier, one had to reach the level of CD4 count of 350 to be on first line ART, it was then changed to 500 and now, the moment you are tested you are to be treated with ART. 
,
,India, has now taken a policy decision to test and treat as soon as the person is detected to be HIV positive, which was recently announced by Union minister of health ,. Though this has been announced, India is still far away from the goal, we don’t even comply with the CD4 500 regime till now. 
,
,Moreover, the HIV Act, which has been recently passed in a cause for concern because under Section 14 of the HIV Act, a caveat is introduced by providing that treatment services would be provided ‘as far as possible’. It appears to many, including the PLHIV community, that ‘as far as possible’ is an escape route for the government to evade its obligations to the community. 
,
,Though it’s a concern we still have to wait and watch whether it actually becomes a problem in the future.

,While police investigation into the case of 8 boys sexually abusing 4 younger boys in 2015 started recently, a CWC inquiry early this month found that four more boys were being sexually abused by three elder boys. A FIR was filed on May 5.
,
,“There have been cases of sexual harassment in the home and there were reports in the local media that some children might have got infected with HIV. Hence, we have decided to check if any child is infected with HIV. There are 77 children at the home and the HIV , will be carried out at the Sassoon General Hospital,” said Anita Wipat, chairperson, CWC.

, (NACO) previously recommended ART only for those HIV-positive people whose CD4 count (measure of a type of white blood cells) was less than 350 cell millimeter cube on two occasions three months apart.
,
,The new 'test and treat' policy means MDACS has to find the 8,000 people who got themselves tested at various government-run testing centres over the last few years, but were not put on ART because they didn't fulfill the previous NACO guidelines. At present, 33,000 positive people are on ART in Mumbai.
,
,“We have asked the various , (ICTCs) in the city to compile a list of people who tested positive at their centre but are not on ART,“ said MDACS additional project director Dr Srikala ,. Considering that ICTCs gets a mixed crowd including migrants, it is not likely to be an easy exercise.
,
,“We not only have to locate them, we have to get a fresh CD4 count done. Thereafter, we have to counsel them about taking ART,“ said Dr Acharya. The HIV virus remains asymptomatic for years, and it's only when the viral load increases beyond a limit that HIV-positive people start exhibiting outward symptoms such as weight loss and poor immunity against diseases.
,
,“Adherence will be a big issue because why would asymptomatic HIV-positive people take strong medicines like ART,“ said infectious diseases specialist and immunologist Dr Om ,.People need to be counseled about the benefits of ART in the long run (see box).
,
,Latest research published in the Lancet said life expectancy for young HIV-positive adults has risen by 10 years in the United States and Europe due to antiretroviral therapy. “This meant many patients can expect to live as long as those without HIV,“ said the Lancet report.
,
,Moreover, there could an increase in drug resistance if positive people start ART and discontinue it mid-way. “India has to be ready for people developing resistance to firstand second-line drugs. Adequate stocks of secondand third-line drugs should be maintained,“ said Dr Srivastava, who said the private sector had started its 'test and treat' policy over two years ago.
,
,However, MDACS's Dr Acharya said that there were adequate stocks of all ART drug combinations in Mumbai.
,
,Another senior doctor in the government sector, howe ver, was skeptical about the 'test and treat' policy. “It seems to be a pharma-driven agenda to boost sales of medicines,“ said the doctor.

According to estimates, there are 66,000 IDUs in the northeast. As per HIV Sentinel Surveillance data, IDUs constitute 1.46% of the high-risk group for HIV. 

,Kailash Ditya, deputy team leader of Project Sunrise, a project that oversees a prison intervention program (PIP) for high risk groups among prisoners, told TOI that 40 inmates at , with a history of IDUs have been tested for , since January. ""We are working on to bring down demand, supply and harm reduction among the inmates. There is also risk assessment at the same time among the inmates"" said Ditya. 
,
,Though harm reduction programmes (HRN) and oral/opiod substitution therapy (OST) is gaining ground in HIV-afflicted states like Manipur, ,, Nagaland and Mizoram, reaching OST to all parts of the northeast is a challenge because 84% of the population in the northeast resides in rural areas. 
,
,""The Centre has to initiate a surveillance system for HCV at the earliest. IDUs are most vulnerable to HCV. There is no data of how many are affected. There is the need for estimation and study of the disease burden of HCV. Without estimation, proper policy cannot be formulated,"" said Ketholelie Angami, the chairperson of Northeast Hepatitis C ,.

Following the Centre’s guideline, the state health department will make available ‘test and treat’ facility to the people from the day they are detected ,. 

,HIV targets and destroys CD4 T cells that strengthen immunity in a person. , positive patients, whose CD4 cell count is below 400, are treated free of cost at ART centres in Bihar. Patients with a CD4 count below 200 are susceptible to develop serious illnesses. 
,
,“Now, as soon as a person is tested and found HIV positive, s/he will be eligible for ART irrespective of his CD count or clinical stage. This will help save patients from many opportunistic infections. Patients will be monitored after every six months,” said Bihar State Aids Control Society’s (BSACS) care and support treatment’s joint director Dr Basuki Nath Gupta. 
,
,“Although all HIV positive patients, irrespective of their CD4 count and asymptomatic infection will now be eligible for ART, all the treatment protocols will be followed. Before we start ART, we test the patient to rule out all opportunistic infections. If the patient is suffering from any sort of infection, in most cases it is tuberculosis, then we treat him for that infection first before starting ART,” said Dr Mukul Kumar of the ART centre at Patna Medical College and Hospital.
,
,He said early treatment increases immunity and the longevity of the patient and reduces the chances of getting opportunistic infections in future.
,
,Dr Diwakar Tejaswi, who is the medical director of Regional AIDS Training Centre and Network and a member of ,, said although this strategy had been implemented by WHO and other internal societies 3 years back, the Indian government move is welcomed.
,
,“Early treatment reduces the morbidity and mortality rate significantly. Treating a patient early means we may be able to keep the person immune from TB and fungal infections. Also, the viral load becomes nearly undetectable in the blood, thus reducing the transmission to almost zero,” said Tejashwi. He said the patient would be getting treatment even before he suffers any illness due to HIV. “It is cost effective and suppresses the disease from spreading” he added.

"Jul 18, 2017, 08:00 IST",Toe-reading astrologer works to make future of HIV-infected kids better,"Predicting the future and looking into the past by reading the lines on one's big toe may at best be called debatable. But the money an astrologer earns from this unique practice undoubtedly serves a good social cause. With the income he makes, astrologer , supports at least 30 , children in his village in , district. 

,Astrology's purpose, according to Vijay, is to interpret the positions of the planets and stars in the sky to gather information on an individual. But in his social life, it goes beyond that. 
,
,Vijay learnt the art after studying in detail the lines and patterns on one's big toe. For him, it all began at the age of 18. Today, he has read the lines on more than 4,500 big toes of people from different walks of life. Solutions may vary, but it's his devotion for this rare field of astrology that still brings people to his village called Avalpunthurai, 12 km from Erode. 
,
,As a child, Vijay was different from his friends. Besides being a staunch devotee of lord Shiva, he was fond of dogs, considered the vahana (vehicle) of the lord. To express his devotion towards dogs, he even ran a shelter for dogs in his village. ""I was a devotee of Shiva from my childhood. 
,
,When I grew up, I used to dream of the lord. It was in one such dream that I got the idea of toe-reading,"" said Vijay, who was in Chennai recently. Vijay takes the print of one's big toe and studies the various lines on it. ""It takes four to five hours in some cases, but I could give solutions to most people who have approached me so far,"" he said.
,
,But learning to read the lines on one's big toe was not easy as Vijay didn't have any basic training on astrology. When he turned 18, Vijay started studying toe-prints of people and conducted research on how they are related to one's past and present.
,
,Vijay first started taking the toe-prints of some drunkards in his village. He then started analyzing the lines on the big toes of people who are suffering from health problems. It took a couple of years for him to understand the difference between the lines found on toes of people suffering from various issues. 
,
,""People in my village thought I was mad. And my strong faith in lord Shiva was another reason for them to feel so. But I didn't look back. I studied the toe-prints of more than 1,000 people during my research. It was after getting a clear understanding about the subject, I began reading the big toes of people and started giving solutions to their problems,"" said 38-year-old Vijay.
,
,What makes Vijay truly different, however, is the noble act that he does for the HIV-infected children in his village. ""I am not doing toe-reading for money. I am doing this under the instruction from my god. The money is used for the welfare of some 30 HIV-infected children in my village,"" he said.

,
,Overall, the state has an estimated 400 such AIDS patients who contacted the dreaded virus through intravenous drug injections. Apart from the street drugs, even prescription drugs like tablets, capsules and liquids are injected occasionally, say insiders.
,
,""Drug abusers often begin with taking pills or snorting drugs in the powdered form, slowly graduate to the intravenous method. Most of the abusers are obsessed with being on a perpetual high. Over time, the usage of pills, capsules, puffing and snorting slowly reduce the impact and hence they switch to intravenous drugs,"" said an official at the Narcotics Control Bureau.

,These injectable drugs are often make from powder or crystal form of drugs by dissolving them in water. Sometimes it is even heated up if required and later drawn in to the syringe by dipping a cotton ball into the solution. ""The fact that many of the drug users also have unsafe sexual practices, increase the risk of HIV due to sharing of the syringes,"" added the official.
,
,Apart from getting a high, there are many more reasons why addicts graduate to intravenous drugs say experts, even if it comes with the highest risk of contracting AIDS as well as other blood-related infections. 
,
,""The type of injected drug are opioids- the most well-known of which is heroin. Other opioid medicines that IV drugs users frequently abuse are fentanyl, Talwin and buprenorphine, as well as the prescription painkillers oxycodone and hydrocodone (the latter two are first crushed into a powder and then dissolved into a solution for injection),"" added Dr ,, senior consultant internal medicine, Maxcure hospitals.

"Aug 4, 2017, 10:27 IST","HIV on the decline, syphilis cases up","CHENNAI: When a 30-year-old came to him with an unhealed sore and swelling in his armpits and groin, Dr M Balasubramanian, a physician in Tambaram, had a hunch. He had become familiar with the symptoms while undertaking a survey in the Western Ghats in the late 70s. Two tests later, he was proved right. The man had syphilis, a sexually-transmitted disease the septuagenarian white-coat thought he wouldn't see again.

,A once common STD in the pre-antibiotic era, the prevalence of syphilis was brought down from 8% of the population to less than 1%. In 2011, the National Aids Control Organsiation (NACO) had announced that the country is on the verge of eliminating the bacterial infection. However, six years on, doctors say they are seeing a rise in those testing positive for syphilis among other sexually transmitted diseases, even as the prevalence of HIV is on the decline.
,
,Data accessed by TOI from , State Aids Control Society (TANSACS) has shown that from 2014 to 2016, the number of those who tested positive for HIV went down from 16,708 to 11,395 ­ a 30% decline, with the number of new cases detected decreasing by half from around 2,700. The second most common STD was Herpes genetalis -marked by genital pain and sores in some, and no symptoms in most --which, too, went down by close to 40% from 2014-2016. The biggest surprise for officials was the increase in syphilis cases from around 1,300 in 2014 to 1,700 the following year.
,
,“This could be because of better awareness and surveillance,“ said Dr K Senthil Raj, TANSACS director, adding that many of these cases were picked up in Chennai, Salem and Nammakkal. Researchers say syphilis is on a gradual incline across the country along with other STDs like genital infection caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) and, in some pockets, Herpes genetalis.
,
,“And in some groups like men who have sex with men, the prevalence of syphilis is significantly high,“ said Dr R R Gangakhedkar, director-incharge of National AIDS Research Institute. He said the prevalence of HIV has decreased across the country because of better intervention by Anti-Retroviral Therapy centres.
,
,“While these centres cut the HIV transmission by 93%, alot of other STDs go missed,“ he added. While the transmission efficiency of HIV is low, varying between one in 100 to one in 1000, syphilis occurs in one in 30 people who has come in contact with a carrier. On the brighter side, he said most of those with STDs come at an early stage because of better awareness and hence treated before complications set in.
,
,India records 30 million episodes of STDs annually , of which the government treats about 10 million.
,
,While government facilities target high-risk groups like the transgender community , female sex workers and homosexual groups, private labs say they have been seeing a steady increase in those reporting with STDs among the general population, especially in the 18-35 years age group.
,
,“We have seen a 20% rise of cases of HPV and Herpes. Some of the STDs are detected when the person presents with infertility-related problems,“ said Dr Anita Suryanarayan, vice-president, operations (south India), ,. While the government has several targeted interventions for promoting safe sex, awareness is relatively low among youngsters from the middle and upper class, she felt.

,Students belonging to “disadvantaged groups” get a host of benefits, including reserved seats in institutions as well as grants, scholarships and hostel facilities.
,
,The state government recently issued the notification to all heads of schools, affiliated to the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, asking them to pass on the benefits of “disadvantaged group” students to HIV-positive parents’ children and HIV-positive children. 
,
,Bengal joins other states, like Kerala, Puducherry, Goa, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, in following a , directive asking state governments to consider issuing such a notification.
,
,“The change of rules will ensure these students get the same facilities that SC, ST students and those classified under minority groups get under the provisions of the RTE Act, 2009. They will get government grants, reservation, scholarships and hostel facilities like the other disadvantaged students. The notification has already been sent to all WBBSE schools,” a senior school education department official said.

"Aug 23, 2017, 07:14 IST",Most new HIV infections detected in 2016-17 were from Maharashtra,"Mumbai: Maharashtra detected the highest number of new , among states in 2016-17, accounting for 16% of the country’s 1.84 lakh fresh cases. Among the infected were 1,567 newborns who probably didn’t get the preventive drugs on time, while 200 adults got the disease due to transfusion with infected blood.

,This is the second year in a row when the state held on to the dubious distinction of reporting maximum cases after occupying the second and third positions through the last decade. Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka were the only states to report 20,000-plus new infections in 2016-17.
,
, data obtained from the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) showed while the state is recording a year-on-year decline, the rate is less than many other high-prevalence states. The state also reported the most mother-to-child transmissions in the country. In the last five years, at least 10,449 newborns got the infection despite the availability of the triple-drug regimen that cuts chances of transmission by 99%. 
,
,Head of state-run JJ Hospital in Byculla, Dr Ashok Anand, said they have not delivered a single HIV-positive baby in the last three to four years. “Giving anti-retroviral to babies soon after birth as well as putting the mother on anti-retroviral therapy early has proved to be very effective,” he said. Chetan Kothari, who filed the RTI said, “It is shameful that even today babies are getting the deadly disease when drugs are readily available.” 
,
,Parimal Singh, who heads the , (MSACS), defended the programme and said not just mother-to-child transmission but , among general and high-risk populations has been on a decline. “It must be taken into consideration that we came to the top spot only after Andhra Pradesh was divided. As far as babies getting HIV is concerned, today HIV+ mothers are no longer afraid of giving birth and this is the programme’s achievement,” he said. MSACS’ data shows from 2009-10 when HIV positivity in general population was around 5.23%, it has dropped to less than 1% today. 
,
,State’s public health minister Dr , added Maharashtra is in a vulnerable position given the huge load of migration. Data also shows a dip in transmission of the disease among homosexuals, bisexuals and transgenders. A few stakeholders however contest intervention to contain HIV in the state has lost steam. Arup Mukherjee, secretary general of the Nagpur-based Indian Red Cross Society, said a fund crunch has been hampering the project for the last two years. “The attrition rate is huge as NGOs are struggling to pay salaries on time. Often testing kits are not available,” he said. Sawant said NACO is responsible for providing 75% of funds. “The state is doing its bit,” he said.

The move is, however, being seen as a ‘ridiculous’ one by social activists as they see it as an infringement of privacy of people living with HIV.

,When a 45-year-old HIV patient reached Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre at Sawai Man Singh Hospital to get medicines, the healthcare staff asked her to submit Aadhaar card’s photocopy. “They asked me if I have Aadhaar card and that I should submit its photocopy,” the patient who is taking medicine for HIV for over 10 years, said.
,
,The RSACS has sent messages to all its ART centres, which provide medicines to people with HIV/AIDS across the state, to collect Aadhaar from beneficiaries.
,
,“Other departments are also linking social benefit schemes with Aadhaar, so we have also decided to link it. But, we have not made it compulsory for getting medicines. If a person does not have Aadhaar, he/she will continue to get medicines. We will not stop providing them medicines,” said Dr S S Chauhan, director, RSACS.
,
,In the state, there are 23 ART centres that provide testing and treatment facilities to 55,000 odd people living with HIV.
,
,Officials said that Aadhaar will help in keeping a track on beneficiaries (people living with HIV), who go missing during treatment. Also, through Aadhaar, department will ensure that a particular beneficiary is not registered at different ART centres. They will generate a whole database online, which will have their Aadhaar number. If a person goes to an ART for HIV testing, the online software through Aadhaar will detect automatically if he is already registered at some other ART.
,
,Reacting on it, social activists are apprehensive that this may increase risk of revealing identity of people living with HIV/AIDS.
,
,“HIV is a severe privacy issue. But it has been seen in the past that your Aadhaar is compromised at many places. There are instances of it being stolen. The question arises that how the state government will keep such database safe,” said activist Nikhil Dey.
,
,Dey said, “Once it’s leaked, how they (those who get it) will use it. There is a stigma attached to HIV, so it is ridiculous to collect Aadhaar from those who are already marginalised. If they made it mandatory, there are chances of exclusion of those who do not have Aadhaar from getting benefits of government schemes.”
,
,Social activists termed the step as “ridiculous”. Collecting Aadhaar from all people living with HIV/AIDS is quite challenging at a time when such people living with HIV/AIDS registered at ART do not share even their original name and address to ensure their original identity is not revealed to anyone, even at ART centres.

"Oct 10, 2017, 03:19 IST",Rap for blood banks over negligence with HIV+ donors,"MUMBAI: Several blood banks in the city may be faltering in one of their basic, yet crucial, responsibilities, which is to refer donors to , if they are found to be infected with the virus.

,It was recently found that while 489 units of blood were found to be HIV positive in 2016-17, only 230 donors were subsequently referred to the , (ICTC).
,
,Failure of blood banks to link HIV-infected patients with ICTC centres—where the infection is confirmed and further management of the disease facilitated— could not just lead to the individual going without antiretroviral therapy, but also infecting others inadvertently.
,
,At a review meeting held by the , (MDACS) in July, the findings were discussed with blood banks, who have now been asked to be more diligent in linking donors.
,
,HIV positivity in the city in 2016-17 was found to be 0.3%, which is lower than the national average of 0.136%. While the overall HIV positivity in blood units collected in the city has been decreasing, it seems that the infection rate at the National AIDS Control Organisation-supported blood banks has remained stagnant for the last four years. An average of 480 units of HIV-infected blood is detected every year. Interestingly, HIV positivity in non-NACO blood banks has been showing a steady decrease.
,
,A third of the 61 blood banks in Mumbai are supported by NACO and most of these are in public hospitals. 
,
,Dr Shrikala Acharya, assistant project director of MDACS, said as per National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC) guidelines blood banks should collect information about donors in case they need to be contacted for counselling or treatment in the event of their reports indicating positive for an infection. “It’s a part of the pre-donor counselling that is supposed to be done before blood collection. It is not mandatory, but it is a part of the guidelines,” she said.
,
,Acharya added, “Often blood units are collected through camps, where a person may or may not have given his contact details. This is why we are strengthening referral systems.”

People of all walks of life make it a point to celebrate this festival. With increasing social concerns, people prefer to lace their celebrations with a good deed. A group of like-minded people started working a fortnight ahead of Diwali to collate whatever they could like money and clothes and distribute them among the orphans and elderly. This year too, they collected the materials but there was a certain delay due to GST and finances were tight.

For the past three years, they set up a stall in one of the textile showrooms to collect money or clothes from people shopping in the textiles outlet. After required money is mobilised, they take the children from orphanages for shopping before the shop opens for public. This year, however, there was considerable delay in collating money and clothes. “We could not take children for shopping. Most of them donate food on Diwali days, but clothes, sweets and crackers make their Diwali which is the reason we collect these goodies for them,” said S Malaisamy, managing trustee of Padikattugal.
,
,In spite of financial constraints, generosity of willing public surpasses the difficulties, quipped V P Manikandan, a social worker in the city. “It is true that money was tight this year but good-hearted people do contribute whatever they can”, he mentioned. On Wednesday, Manikandan along with volunteers and social workers will be visiting couple of orphanages and old age homes to celebrate ,. “More than goodies, the rejected lot of society enjoy company of people. There are some to remember them”, he added.
,
,Even ahead of Diwali, a group of transgenders celebrated the festival with the corporation home for destitutes at Uthangudi. As many as 150 students from Maharishi Vidhya Mandir School, Kovilpappakudi decided to celebrate the festival with differently-abled children. On Monday, they visited Able Kids Special School at Arapalayam. They conducted cultural programmes for these special children and they had a great time together.

"Updated: Dec 1, 2017, 13:32 IST",42% drop in new HIV positive cases in state in 7 years,"Nagpur: In the last seven years, the rate of new HIV-positive cases in the state has declined by about 42%. As far as mortality due to HIV is concerned, it has declined threefold in last 13 years.

,The facts were revealed by Dr Pramod Deoraj, an official from , (MSACS) on the occasion of World AIDS Day that falls on December 1.
,
,Deoraj said, “The high rates of positive cases and deaths in the past were because earlier we had fewer ART centres, less medicine stock and not every HIV positive patient received free drugs from government due to criteria called CD4.”
,
,An official notification on May 5 this year made it possible to “treat all” living with HIV regardless of their CD4 cell count (a test that measures the strength of one’s immune system). It has further contributed to decline of new cases.
,
,Deoraj said, “Within the state there were about 23,000 HIV+ve patients who couldn’t get the treatment because of this criteria. With the new guidelines, the government has CD4 clause and we are having a good start. In the last six months we have reached out to over 15,000 patients through ART centres and have been able to begin treatment of about 8000.”
,
,Deoraj said, “In 2010, we used to record about 52,000 new HIV positive cases every year. Last year, the figure fell to 22,000. We have observed that the number is falling by about 1000 to 1200 every year. In 2004 the death rate for HIV positive patients used to be 15% and that has fallen to 5% now.”
,
,The state government has total 73 antiretroviral therapy (ART) centres where free drugs are given. Three centres in Nagpur district are in the medicine department of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), at , Government Medical College and Hospital (IGMCH) and another at a public health facility in Kamptee.
,
,Officer of District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) , said, “In the district, we also have 21 Integrated , (ICTC) where patients are tested for HIV, counselled and connected with ARTs. In 2015, the district received a mobile van to perform as ICTC in remote areas. Last year, we received another van from the collector.”
,
,An , query by activist , revealed the ART record of GMCH between the year 2014 and 2016. There is a consistent decline in positive cases here too. The number of deaths came drastically down from 50 to 15 in 2015 but again rose to 30 in 2016.

However, some people living with , in Mysuru feel stigmatized as people in the medical profession themselves are looking at them as ‘aliens’ by delaying treatment.

,Sources in Ananda Jyothi Positive Network, an organization of positive people working for the welfare of community members, claimed that doctors are avoiding treating HIV patients. They claim to have come across two cases wherein HIV patients were asked to wait for some time to get treatment after the doctors learnt they were HIV patients.
,
,The first patient, who had a heart ailment, was asked to come back after a few weeks. The second patient, a woman who was suffering from uterine prolapse, was told there were no beds at the hospital, they said.
,
,Deepa, a non-community coordinator, claimed that doctors do not deny providing treatment but delay it. “They also ask for proof whether they had given them in writing that they wouldn’t treat them. We have intervened and in talks with authorities concerned to get them treatment,” she added.
,
,Treatment for co-infection like tuberculosis is easily available and it is not the case for co-morbidities like tooth ache, heart and kidney problems, claim sources. After the National Community Care Centre scheme, which reserved 10 beds for HIV patients and offered free treatment, was scrapped in 2012, treatment for HIV patients has taken a beating, sources add.
,
,AIDS programme Officer (in-charge) Dr C Suvarna admitted that the issue of delayed treatment was raised at a meeting but specific instances were not brought up to them. “No one can deny treatment and in such a case one can complain to us,” she said. The officer however claimed that for medical reasons treatment could have been delayed or postponed. “Moreover, surgeries have to be done under extra care and it would take some time. We can analyse if the case was brought to us and whether it is ‘willful’ delay or not,” she said.

,
,“This club will help young people allocate time to tend to their emotional needs at a critical juncture in their life, where establishing peer relationships is particularly important. Unlike other teenagers, there is a heightened risk among HIV+ adolescents to feel excluded and isolated. They are at a far greater risk of not seeking treatment, or dropping out once treatment begins,” Borges says.
,
,There are around 310 children known to be living with HIV in the state, of which around 200 belong to the adolescent age group (10-19 years). A majority live with their families, sometimes with single parents and extended families. There are also a substantial number of orphans, close to 40 of whom are housed in three institutions in Tivim, Cavelossim and Rivona.

Finding innovative ways to establish youth as actors in their own treatment would have onward benefits, as they gain confidence navigating healthcare systems.

"Dec 1, 2017, 01:14 IST","Soon, test to measure amount of HIV virus in patients’ blood","MUMBAI: Following years of protest, the Centre is set to roll out the , for HIV/AIDS , in the next six months across the country. The test essentially tells whether the treatment regimen is working or not by measuring the amount of , virus in a patient’s blood.

,The , (NACO) has already shortlisted laboratories across the country that would be scaled up to carry out the tests. However, it may be a while before every patient on antiretroviral therapy (ART) qualifies to undergo the expensive test, which costs between Rs 6,000 and Rs 8,000 in a private laboratory.
,
,In 2013, the WHO had recommended the viral load-test be carried out within six months of starting an individual on ART and be repeated at the end of that year. Subsequently, it should be carried out annually. People living with HIV and NGOs have since been fighting for the test to be made routinely available and more accessible.
,
,
, 
,
,“From February onward, 532 ART centres across the country will have the viral load-testing facility. In the initial phases, it will be offered to children below the age of five years, people taking treatment for five years and those suffering from HIV-TB co-infection. They have been chosen keeping the criticality of their condition in mind. The test will subsequently be available to all 1.2 million people on ART treatment in the country,” said Dr R S Gupta of NACO’s Care, Support and Treatment division. The civic-run KEM and Nair hospitals are likely to be the centres in the city.
,
,Currently, the test is selectively offered at the state-run JJ Hospital, where patients have to go through the stringent scrutiny of a committee.
,
,“The body takes between four and six months only to decide who will undergo the test. It’s unfortunate that in the absence of a viral load-test, the programme solely relies on CD4 count,” said Ganesh Acharya, a member of the Mumbai Aids Forum (MAF). CD4 is an indicator of the body’s immune system. “But it’s only part information about what the virus is doing with the immune system. A high viral load in the body will usually, but not always, mean a low CD4 count,” said infectious disease expert Dr Om Srivastava, who recommends viral load-testing every six months to one year.
,
,“Because of the unavailability of the test, patients also often don’t realize when they have become resistant to the first line or second line drugs,” said Poonam Patkar, secretary of MAF.
,
,Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) India that offers viral load-testing to KEM patients as a special model, run in collaboration with the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS), said they have got great results in picking treatment failures early and improving outcomes by addressing non-adherence in patients. The MSF data collated from KEM has shown that 90% of the patients were responding to the treatment offered under the national programme as their viral loads were suppressed.

This was stated in the 2016-17 report of Thane’s District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU). However, there has been a drop in the number of cases in the entire district.

,The officials claimed that Thane city, comprising of Thane, Mira Road and Bhayander, had more people who belong to the high risk population. Navi Mumbai and Bhiwandi were among the top three places in the district that were detected with the most number of cases.
,
,“These cities not only have a high population, but also have people from the high risk zone —like sex workers, migrants, transgenders, truck drivers, etc. It was also seen that out of the ones who were detected positive, 80% got infected due to unsafe sex. While others got it through blood transfusion. Though 110 pregnant women were detected HIV positive in 2016-17, the number has decreased as compared to the 2015-16 figures that stood at 153 women affected with the virus. This drop is because of the awareness drives being carried out by various organisations,” said Ratan Gadhave, district programme officer of theDAPCU.

,The department, along with 33 NGOs, conduct awareness drives on regular basis and focus more on the people belonging to the high risk communities.
,
,“Out of those who fall under the high risk category, the highest number of people tested positive were migrant workers and and truck drivers. But there has been a rise in the number of patients taking the HIV test. This is because of the awareness drives we have been carrying out in these pockets. During these drives, we request those infected with the virus to come to the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre for tests,” said Gadhave.

In another part of the country, a blood transfusion brought Radhika’s* dreams crashing down. But instead of letting their HIV+ve diagnoses fill their lives with negativity, they decided to stay positive. Brought together by a twist of fate and the late Dr Suniti Solomon, the pioneer of , research in India, the couple is now proud parents to a 16-year-old, and productive members of society.

,""When I was first diagnosed with HIV, I was terrified,"" says Chennai-based Arun, who was referred to Dr Solomon of YRG CARE. ""She reassured me that I could still lead a normal life as long as I took medication, and adopted a healthy lifestyle. Getting to know other people living with HIV helped me overcome my fears,"" says Arun, who gave up smoking and drinking.
,
,Two years later, when Dr Solomon asked him if he was looking for a life partner, Arun was ready to take the next step forward. ""I hadn’t told my parents or siblings that I am HIV+ve so they were keen to see me married. I wanted a companion but didn’t want to spoil the life of another person, so I decided to marry a woman who was also HIV+ve,"" says Arun, an engineer.
,
,Dr Solomon, who documented the first cases of HIV in India in 1986 among sex workers, took voluntary retirement in 1993 to establish YRG Care. In the latter part of her career — as people began living longer with generic anti-retroviral medications and faced the same pressure at home to get married — she began helping healthy patients find life partners. Though the centre has played ‘matchmaker’ for 30 couples so far, Arun and Radhika’s was the first success story.
,
,With Dr Solomon’s encouragement, Arun decided to meet prospective brides. That’s when Dr Solomon heard about Radhika, a young woman from Maharashtra. And once Arun met her and her family, he was quick to make up his mind. 
,
,Radhika, who takes tuitions at home, was also willing to take the plunge. ""I didn’t want to be alone for the rest of my life, and wanted the emotional support a partner can give,"" she says. The next hurdle was convincing his parents who were still unaware that he is HIV+ve. Arun’s family was quick to come around and the only barrier was language.
,
,But there was another, bigger challenge ahead. The couple, who got married in July 2001, discovered that Radhika was pregnant in September. ""We were scared but both of us were on medication and our son, born in 2002, is HIV-ve,"" says Arun.
,
,Till today, they have not disclosed their HIV+ve identity to friends, Arun’s family, or their son.
,
,""There is still some stigma attached to the disease as people have misconceptions about it,"" says Radhika. ""But there is nothing to fear. We take our medicines every day, eat healthy and go to the hospital every six months to check our CD4 (white blood cell counts) and viral loads,"" says Radhika.
,
,Arun says getting married and having a child has given direction to his life. ""If you live on your own, you can get depressed. My outlook to life changed after marriage, and now I have a son to live and work for, which gives purpose to my life,"" he says.
,
,He has just one word of advice for people. ""If you are in the high-risk group, do go to the doctor and get an HIV test done. With timely and regular treatment, you can lead a normal life.""

"Dec 3, 2017, 05:32 IST",‘HIV infection leads to many brain infections’,"Nagpur: , infection is known to bring many other infections along with it. In South Africa it is increasingly leading to brain infections. Doctors claimed that HIV/AIDS is also increasing the incidence of strokes and epilepsy.

,Dr John Ouma, of the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, told TOI that though the commonest of infection that comes with HIV is tuberculosis, HIV infection and seizures were also related. 
,
,“Hence, epilepsy was a common disease. One in hundred persons suffers from epilepsy at some point of time in life. In fact, Neuro-AIDS is a commonly used word in South Africa and neuro-cognitive disorders caused due AIDS are a topic of research,” he said.
,
,Dr Ouma is in the city for the five-day annual conference of the Neurological Society of India being hosted by the Nagpur Neuro Society. 
,
,Dr Ouma said that Africa had a very small number of neurologists and neurosurgeons. Hence, a large number of the patients from Africa come to India for treatment. 
,
,“India has a majority of the advanced equipment and innovation in the field. The treatment here is available at less than one fourth the cost of the developed countries. Hence a lot of medical tourism happens between India and South Africa,” he said. 
,
,Medical tourism, Dr Ouma said, was possible also due to the liberal policies of the Indian government unlike the USA which asks for “cumbersome paper work”.
,
,Dr Ouma said that despite all the developments in the brain sciences, man seems to have understood less than 5% of the functioning of the brain. “There is so much of scope for research in neurosciences, neurobiology, neuropathology etc that amazing work can be done by neurologists and neurosurgeons in future when they understand the brain more,” he said.

Going by the , (DAPCU), of late, there has been an increase in cases between the age group of 40 to 49 years. Experts say the major reason for the change in trend in the viral disease is due to extramarital affairs. 

,District Program Manager (DPM) of DAPCU, Trichy Dr SM Manivannan says, “The trend has changed after 2011. Analysis shows that the trend is a consequence of illicit affairs among married people. But on the whole, the prevalence of HIV-AIDS is declining.”
,
,Earlier, the incidence was prevalent among people in the age group of 30 to 39 years, due to the unawareness of the high risk behavior groups - Female Sex Workers (FSW), Men Sex with Men (MSM) and transgender (TG). “HIV positive was high among the risk behavior groups, but after 2011 the trend declined and common people too have been tested positive,” said Dr Manivannan.
,
,Stating that the number of infected people is under control in Trichy district, the DPM said that currently 5,500 people were on Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) treatment here. The number included FSW, MSM, TG and normal people.
,
,Few years ago, there was a panic among HIV-infected people that the viral infection was the end of their life. Now, doctors term it as a chronically manageable disease. “If a patient is regularly on ART, the life expectancy of the patient will not decrease,” said Dr , at ART Centre inside , (MGMGH). ART is a tablet which was prescribed to those who had CD4 count below 300. However, the tablet has been made available to all infected people irrespective of their CD4 count. 
,
,“The regular follow-up on patients and intake of ART tablet increases the longevity of the patients. If anyone was missing out on treatment, the Target Intervention (TI)-NGOs will keep track of them and bring them back on track for treatment,” he said.

We have tied up with the Punjab State AIDS Control Society, which will give us the medicines.

She also said they would reimburse patients who buy medicines from the market.

This is expected to provide protection to these children from being denied admission and from being expelled from schools. In 2014, the plight of HIV-infected children in the state came to light when 13 HIV-infected orphans were expelled from a school in Rivona after parents of other students discovered their condition and demanded they not be allowed to study in the school. The students also had to change schools twice due to the objection raised by parents of other children.

,When a Delhi-based NGO petitioned the Supreme Court, and the apex , ruled in March this year that states include HIV-infected children in the disadvantaged group under RTE, the Goa government was forced to act on those lines. While the court had appreciated 11 states and union territories for already including HIV-infected children as a disadvantaged group, it turned out Goa was among the states that had not protected these children under the RTE Act, even though Goa notified its RTE rules seven years ago, in 2010.
,
,The state finally issued the notification in September this year.
,
,The extension of protected status to children in Goa living with or infected with HIV means that they are now entitled to special protection and measures under the terms of the RTE Act. These include eradication of discrimination, harassment, and victimisation. It will eliminate discrimination in relation to the admissions process including denying or limiting access to any benefits of enrolment or through segregation in separate study, sports, playground or canteen areas or in any other amenities provided by the school.

"Updated: Dec 11, 2017, 13:19 IST",Wives at HIV risk from bisexual husbands,"When Savitha’s* husband returned at four in the morning, the scent of a woman on him roused her suspicion. The 36-year-old mother of two dug into his bag to find a sari, a lipstick and wilted flowers. Her husband, she later found, was a bisexual cross-dresser. 

,Four years on, Savitha remains married to the same man. Her voice — narrating her husband’s affairs with other men — is among those documented by researchers who studied HIV-related risks among married , (MSM) and their ,. 
,
,According to a 2012 study by National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), MSM are at 12 to15 times higher risk of contracting , compared to other men. The recent study found that the HIV-related risks for the spouses of MSM were multiple, yet they are not covered under any intervention programmes of the government. 
,
,Forty six MSMs were interviewed across five states including the cities of Chennai and Madurai. Of these, 13 , were aware of their husbands’ sexual orientation. Men in these marriages were the primary decision-makers about sex and condom use.
,
,""The men used condoms inconsistently with their male partners,"" said Sunil Solomon of Y R Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Research and Education, a co-author of the study. ""The women in these relationships are vulnerable but rarely feature in the country’s HIV intervention programmes. The initiatives mostly address the experiences and perspectives of husbands and their male partners, but not their wives,"" said Solomon, who facilitated the interviews for two teams from , School of Medicine and Durham University. 
,
,
, 
,
,The few women who were interviewed said they came to know about their husbands’ same-sex preference by accident. The men in the study reported having multiple male, and a few female, extramarital sexual partners.
,
,Forty-year-old Vasanth* from Hyderabad, who blamed his family for forcing him to marry, was among those who had not disclosed their orientation to their wives. ""If I tell my wife about my relationship with men, she may harm herself. What will happen if she tells our families? I may be making a mistake, but I cannot trouble her. So my relationship remains a secret,"" he said. 
,
,The study pointed to the high-risk sexual behaviour among MSM and a higher prevalence of HIV among married MSM than unmarried ones. The pressure on them to conform to heteronormative masculine norms leads to hurried and unsafe sex with multiple partners. 
,
,Many MSMs are also victims of blackmail. ""Their male partners threaten to expose them to their wives if they don’t listen to their demands. In the process, they end up having sex without protection,"" said Jaya, general manager of Sahodaran, which operates a helpline for the LGBT community in Chennai. 
,
,Some of the couples surveyed for the study had separated after the women got to know about their husbands’ sexual preferences, while some remained married but no longer had a sex. However, a majority of participants continued to have sex both with their wives and partners. A few of them said they encouraged their wives to have extramarital relationships as they were not attracted to them. Women said they remain in these marriages due to cultural and economic pressures, and some for their children.
,
,Some women, described pressure from their husbands to have anal sex against their wishes. ""Accounts from both husbands and wives in our study indicate that husbands are the primary sexual decision-makers; some men clearly consider it a right. The men interviewed said they did not feel that using condom with their wives was ""necessary"", even when they had unsafe sex with other partners. ‘I have a medical check-up every three months, so what is the need to use condom with my wife?’ asked a 27-year-old bisexual man in Madurai. Condoms were only seen as a birth control measure and not to prevent sexually transmitted diseases,"" said Solomon. ""But, several participants we interviewed were actively seeking a pregnancy at the time of the interview, and consequently avoided using condoms with their wives,"" he added. 
,
,The study said there is an urgent need for interventions to address HIV-related risk posed to wives without the unwanted disclosure of husbands’ same-sex behaviour. ""For instance, engagement of these husbands in pre-exposure prophylaxis (taking HIV medicines daily to lower chances of getting infected) could reduce the men’s own risk of HIV, and thereby also reduce the risk of onward transmission to their wives."" Researchers also suggested forming more support groups for these women.

,Khan was initially hesitant to approach CCDT fearing her privacy would be breached. But it turned out to be the best decision she’d made. “Since my husband was bedridden, I’d given up hope of continuing my children’s education in a good, private school,” she recalls. “But CCDT helped me with the fees.” They also took her husband to a hospital and got him treatment.

,CCDT teaches families about the importance of taking antiretroviral drugs regularly and what do in case a HIV positive family member gets a cut or has an open wound. “We give them a first aid kit and teach them to use gloves,” says Patkar. “If families can’t afford gloves, we tell them to use plastic bags.” They also provide information about treatments. For instance, Khan had no idea that government hospitals provided free antiretroviral treatment and used up all her savings at a private hospital. 
,
,Most families that CCDT works with have a monthly income of about Rs 5,000-6,000 and are daily wagers. This makes CCDT’s nutritional kit of 13 items, including jaggery, peanuts, oil and soyabean, a godsend because it helps supplement their diet when they have to stay home from work because they aren’t feeling well.
,
,To help patients recover hope after being diagnosed, CCDT has set up family support groups that meet every month. “When I joined CCDT’s support group I heard other people sharing their stories and after such a long time…I began to feel hopeful about the future,” CCDT quoted Khan as saying in a press release. Today, Khan wows her family with her sunny outlook and derives satisfaction from counselling new CCDT entrants, who are struggling with their diagnosis.

"Jan 8, 2018, 01:52 IST",HIV wanes in Maha but rages in high-risk groups,"MUMBAI: The recently released , Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) report has some good as well as worrying news for the state. The good news is that the deadly viral disease continues to be on a decline among general population. The worrying part: In certain pockets of the state, the disease is raging among high-risk populations like female sex workers.

,According to the HSS, Maharashtra is 16th in terms of HIV prevalence, a positive shift of four places since the last survey in 2014-15. From 0.29%, the prevalence has reduced to 0.26%. An official from the , (MSACS) said it was a significant drop as the HIV prevalence is now lower than the national average of 0.28%.
,
,But experts say it’s still not time to rejoice as certain sites catering to high-risk populations such as men having sex with men (MSM), injecting drug users and female sex workers have shown a significant prevalence. Though Maharashtra is one of the states to record less than 5% HIV positivity in female sex workers, there are four sites where the prevalence has been found to be 5%. At one site, it was around 10%. Among the female sex workers in the state, the prevalence (3.48%) is more than double the national average (1.56%).
,
,Nagpur-based NGO Indian , (IRCS) that has been working with female sex workers said migration has emerged as a major challenge over the years. “Commercial sex workers have started migrating and moving out of traditional pockets making it difficult to track, test or treat them. It poses a direct threat to the general population,” said Hemlata Lohave from IRCS. She added that dwindling financial resources, too, have made their job difficult. “Often we are working without funds for months. Even now, for instance, we haven’t received money for the last quarter. We regularly lose trained workers as we can’t pay salaries,” she said.
,
,Among MSMs, the state is fifth on the national chart with the prevalence hovering around 4.69%, which is higher than the national average of 2.69%. However, in HSS 2014-15, the HIV prevalence among female sex workers was 7.4% and 4.9% among MSMs.
,
,Mumbai, too, is one of the sites with high HIV prevalence among truckers. There were nine sites with more than 1% HIV prevalence among long-distance truckers, including Mumbai with 1.2% prevalence. 
,
,The MDACS official said the state is working on newer strategies. “We are aware that infections are still high in metropolitan cities. In high-risk pockets, we are testing at the community level. We are also looking at multi-month dispensation of antiretroviral drugs so that a patient can come to us once in three months rather than every month,” he said.

"Updated: Jan 8, 2018, 07:59 IST",Digital tracking of Tamil Nadu HIV patients in works,"CHENNAI: Medical records of , patients in the state will now go digital. The , State , Control Society (TANSACS) will initiate the project on a pilot basis at the antiretroviral therapy centres in Madras Medical College and at the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Egmore, which have around 5,000 HIV-positive patients enrolled in the state programme.

,K Senthil Raj, TANSACS project director, said the patients will also be given a login id, so that they can access their records, including lab results and next appointment with doctors, through their phones. “Starting from the counsellor to the staff nurse and then finally the doctor, details of the patients will be fed into the system. The doctors will have a dashboard with the patient’s medical history,” he said. 
,
, At present, 1.2 lakh people with HIV are on the antiretroviral therapy programme run by the government.
,
,Officials say once a patient tests positive for HIV, the ART centre maintains a ‘white card’ with the patient’s details, while the patient is given a notebook that carries information on their drugs intake and their CD4 count – an important indicator of the immune function and the strongest predictor of HIV progression. A doctor at an ART centre here said many of these cards are simply discarded. “Walk into any of these centres and you will see these cards lying in some corner, gathering dust. We usually refer to the notebooks these patients bring. Mostly we go by the information they provide,” admitted the doctor.
,
,The TANSACS director, too, said poor documentation was a problem. “We also have duplication. A patient who registers at an ART centre in one district later moves to a centre in another district and enrolls as a new patient,” he said, adding that maintaining electronic records will do away with this challenge. “We will also be able to track them better.” 
,
,Tamil Nadu has AIDS testing centres at all district headquarters with more than 55 ART centres and 750 Integrated (Voluntary) and Confidential Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) under the National AIDS , at district level government hospitals and medical colleges across the state. Patients, who are confirmed HIV-positive, visit ART centres at least once a month for drugs and testing. 
,
,While NGOs and experts working with people living with HIV have welcomed the move, they said digitalisation could also raise concerns on privacy. “Many of them lie low as they don’t want people around them to know they are infected. They will be wary if they know their details are available online. The state needs to assuage this by holding awareness camps,” said Vijay Raman from Voluntary Health Services which undertakes projects related to HIV/AIDS among the transgender community.
,
,
,
,
,In an effort to fight misinformation on sexually transmitted infections and diseases, the Tamil Nadu state AIDS control society will soon revamp its website to make it more interactive. Public can clarify doubts about condom use, STDs and STIs by emailing a group of counsellors dedicated for this. The website will be launched on January 11.

The marriage mela is going to be unique this time as marriage seekers will have a broad choice to select their life partners from different states,” GSNP+ president Daxa Patel said.,There is a higher proportion of infected men as compared to women. Owing to higher proportion of infected men, prospective brides usually get a greater freedom in choosing their partners.,The marriage mela will be held at Reliance HIV and TB Centre at Hazira where men would walk up on stage and formally introduce themselves, talking about their profession and income, in front of an audience comprising mostly prospective brides and their family members.,“The prospective grooms and brides have freedom to choose their partners as they walk on stage and talk about themselves.

,A division bench of the HC headed by Justice Surya Kant has issued the notice after taking cognizance of a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by , of , in , tehsil of Patiala district. 
,
,Referring to some media reports, the petitioner has stated in the PIL that at least 1,630 inmates in nine central jails in Punjab have tested positive for HIV. Modern Jail, Fridkot, has the highest number of 439 HIV positive inmates, while , has 30, Ferozepur 322, Amritsar 299, Kapurthala 210, Ludhiana 137, Patiala 75, Hoshiarpur 63 and , 55.
,
,According to the petitioner, spread of HIV positive disease among jail inmates is caused due to sharing of syringes (used for taking drugs) and through sexual contact.
,
,The jail authorities avoid their responsibility by contending that medical examination of persons is not done before lodging them into Jails. Thus, the high incidence of HIV positive cases amongst jail inmates is taking place with connivance of jail officials, and an independent probe should be conducted by a high powered team of retired and honest police officers, advocates and retired judges, the petitioner argued. He added that such team would bring out the true reasons for spread of HIV positive cases among jail inmates. It was further argued that the measures suggested by such a team will go a long way in preventing HIV positive from spreading its wings in jails.
,
,The counsel also pleaded that conducting of medical examination and maintaining of records of such medical examination of persons before lodging them into jail, would prevent spread of this dreadful disease further, and conducting of periodical examination of jail inmates would help fixing responsibility of jail officials, if such a person (who did not test positive for HIV) is later found to be inflicted with the virus.

,At a TOI event related to the national girl child campaign, she talked about the harassment that the HIV-positive people face in hospitals where they go in search of medication. She said: “My husband refused to go to hospital because laboratory technicians would ask him awkward questions like whether he had any extra-marital affair.

A study conducted by the society has found that the Elisa test was more effective than nucleic test.

,HIV screening had become a matter of concern following the detection of the virus in a kid, who underwent blood transfusion at Regional , Centre. Now, National AIDS Control Organisation has informed that it would supply Elisa test kits to the state.
,
,""For the time being, we have supplied enough kits to all government medical college hospitals and Regional Cancer Centre. Moreover, Kerala State Medical Services Corporation (KMSCL) has also been asked to procure the kits, which will be supplied to all the blood banks and hospitals with blood banks,'' said Dr R ,, managing director of KSACS.
,
,As per the study, in the nucleic test the virus could not be detected even for a week after the blood is collected. ""But Elisa test gives more accurate result even during the first one week window period,'' said Dr Ramesh.
,
,In the past one year, KSACS collected 4 lakh blood units, of which 300 were detected with HIV using the third generation Elisa test. ""In the past four years, we might have collected about 25 lakh blood units and only in one case it has gone undetected (in the , incident). Hence our testing facilities are accurate. With this 4th generation test, we can assure 100% safety and accuracy,'' he pointed out.

,On Saturday, Naco instructed all state governments to get patients to undergo routine viral load tests and check mortality rate. A staggering 80,173 people have died of HIV over the past decade in Karnataka, according to the death audit conducted by Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS). 
,
,A total of 3.1 lakh people living with HIV (PLHIV) have registered for ART in the state. Across the country, an estimated 21 lakh HIV positive patients are registered with 525 ART centres. Bengaluru has seven such centres. 
,
,While 3,16,252 people living with HIV have registered for ART treatment in Karnataka as on December 2017, only 1, 65,917 of them actively turn up for follow-ups. The rest are either dead or don’t visit the centres.
,
,The practice till date was to get a patient, whose blood tests positive for HIV, to undergo a CD4 count before starting anti-retro viral drugs. CD4 count is a prognostic indicator where a higher number indicates a stronger immune system. Henceforth, the patient will have to undergo a viral load test too while registering for ART treatment.
,
,“The cost of viral load test in the private sector ranges from Rs 4,000-6,000 and not all can afford it. The government will be spending Rs 1,200 per test,” said an officer from KSAPS. 
,
,This Naco move will be implemented from February 8 through , under a public-private partnership (,) project. In the first year, the agency will conduct 2.1 lakh tests. The remaining patients will be covered in a phased manner.
,
,“Currently, the programme was using targeted viral load testing to confirm suspected treatment failure owing to clinical or immunological failure of the patient. From now on, patients on ART will be monitored via viral load test at regular intervals. The result will allow early detection of potential treatment failure,” a senior officer in KSAPS said. 
,
,Naco had also set a timeline to be followed while conducting viral load testing. “For patients on the first line of treatment, the test should be done twice in the first year, once every six months. From the second year onwards, it should happen once a year. For second/third line patients, it must be conducted once every six months after the patient’s initiation on ART,” said KSAPS officers.
,
,However, NGOs closely working with people living with HIV (PHIV) in creating awareness have questioned the government’s partnership with a private entity. “There is a HIV law in place and the rules are likely to be framed by April 2018. Even before formulating the rules, why has the government tied up with a private party? Besides, if the private agency conducts tests only on 2.1 lakh of the total 21 lakh people registered for ART treatment in the country, it will cover only 10%. What about the rest? Instead, viral load tests should have been mandated for all HIV patients once every six months,” said David Bodapatti, who has been working with PLHIV.

"Updated: Feb 9, 2018, 06:02 IST",Over 500 patients in Maharashtra contracted HIV via infected needles in 5 years: RTI,"MUMBAI: Transmission of HIV through infected needles doesn’t seem to be restricted to villages in Uttar Pradesh alone. Patients in , too have, over the years, claimed to have contracted HIV through infected needles or syringes.

,An , response from , (NACO) showed that over 500 people in the state have got HIV through infected needles. Between 2012-13 and 2016-17, 512 disclosed at Integrated Centres for Testing and Counselling (ICTCs) that exposure to infected needle was responsible for the infection, said RTI activist Chetan Kothari. Numbers suggest an average 70-200 people get HIV through infected needles every year. In 2017-18, 69 people, including 29 women, contracted the infection. 
,
, 
, 
,
,But the numbers have been highly debated by state agencies working towards controlling the disease. Parimal Sinh, who heads the state Aids control society, said less than 0.5% of new infections are due to infected needles. Over 90% of the infection in the state happens through the heterosexual route. 
,
,“More importantly, the needle-infection numbers are based on voluntary disclosures made by people during counselling sessions before and after they are tested for HIV in ICTCs. Often, patients tend to suggest blood transfusion and infection through needles as possible mode of transmission. While our counsellors try to find out the exact reason, we also have to keep in mind the mental state of the patient.” 
,
,Medically too, a single needle usage may not necessarily mean transmission of HIV. Eldred Tellis of Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust, that has been working with intravenous drug users (IDUs), said the virus could survive for three hours in the bore of a needle as there is vacuum, but otherwise it would die within 10 seconds. “But since HIV is a weak virus, the viral load of the infected person has to be really high for transmission. Studies suggest that one in 10 persons will get HIV if the needle is infected.” 
,
, Interestingly, the highest HIV prevalence (7%) in the country is among IDUs, who use addictive substances through injections by exchanging needles. “In most cases, they pull out blood and put it back in the syringe to extract maximum of the drug and inject into veins contributing to high HIV infection,” he said. Tellis added that the authorities must also think of hepatitis C infection as that transmits more efficiently than HIV. “In Mumbai IDUs, hepatitis prevalence is around 35%, whereas HIV is 9.5%,” he said.

,State health department officials said 72 people had contracted the virus in 2017, while 100 were afflicted with it in 2016 through reuse and exposure to contaminated syringes, blood transfusion and exposure to blood products.
,
,
,
, 
,
,
,An official, however, privately admitted that the figures could be much more as several patients remain unaccounted due to poor screening methods as well as HIV infection through dialysis, which is not taken into account in state figures.
,
,“Patients, who undergo haemo dialysis, are highly vulnerable to hepatitis C, B and HIV, if adequate aseptic measures are not in place during dialysis. There is a high percentage of patients battling these deadly infections in the city,” pointed out Mujtaba Hasan ,, president ,, an NGO which works with HIV patients.
,
,Recently, over 50 people were found to be infected with HIV in , in Uttar Pradesh due to use of unsafe medical devices. Experts say mushrooming of blood banks, improper screening of blood and lack of checks were to be blamed for the spread of HIV.
,
,“The , (TSACS) data may not reflect the true picture of new cases being infected through syringes and blood transfusion. Also, the fact that blood transfusion standards are not maintained as many private blood banks have mushroomed. Absence of checks, regulations and safety protocols make matters worse,” Askari pointed out.
,
,Interestingly, the latest and most-updated technology available to detect HIV, nucleic acid test (NAT), is not available in majority of the blood banks in the state.
,
,Currently, ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test as well as manual screening is carried out in majority of blood banks in the state, but these test have their limitations.
,
,“For ELISA test to detect HIV, the virus should have been active for at least 40 days before the test. Also, the manual testing method (for ELISA third generation) has the possibility of the virus not getting detected at all due to human error. Though NAT is the safest (can detect the virus if it has been in the body for seven days), it is a costly affair,” T Vishnu Vardhan, chief executive officer, ,, said.
,
,Of 136 blood banks in the city, 43 facilities, including state-run blood banks, were being supported by , (NACO). And, less than five actually conduct NAT. NACO currently supplies the third generation manual ELISA kit to supported blood banks. “The ELISA test is followed by almost all government as well as private sector blood banks. While one possibility is that the basic antibody test that we are doing does not detect HIV as the antibody has not yet been developed, the possibility of erroneous blood banks, negligence and a small possibility of re-use of syringes cannot be ruled out,” Dr V Rajasekhar, project director, TSACS, said. “So far, no incident of blood banks totally avoiding blood screening has come to our notice,” he added.
,
,Also, once blood banks discover that a patient was HIV positive, they should inform, counsel and inform the TSACS and send the patient to the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) in the district. “Usually, the blood banks do not take it to the logical end when they find a patient is positive, they tend to wash their hands off,” say insiders.

,“As many 73 clinics of alleged quacks have been sealed. An FIR is being registered against three quacks while notices are being served to 44 others, who have been unable to produce degrees or relevant documents for running clinics,” Unnao chief medical officer (CMO) Dr S P Chowdhary told TOI on Saturday.
,
,“If ‘doctors’ are not registered with the Medical Council of India, they have no right to practice medicine. We are taking action on complaints of quackery,” the CMO added.
,
,An official spokesman said while some of these quacks were operating from their houses, others had opened clinics.
,
,“Officials have been asked to verify the credentials of the quacks who run advertisements on local TV channels in the district. The health department teams will also request cable operators to stop advertisements promoting tantriks and quacks,” he added.
,
,Meanwhile, HIV affected people of the three villagers of Bangarmau — Prem Ganj, Chakmir and Kirmidiyapur — have demanded setting up of an antiretroviral therapy (ART) link centre at Bangarmau community health centre (CHC) to facilitate cheap and affordable treatment.
,
,At present, patients are being treated at the ART centre of Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial (GSVM) medical college in Kanpur. ART is a therapy that improves the life quality of HIV patients with treatment that maximally suppresses the HIV virus. 
,
,“My 10-year-old daughter is HIV positive,” said Vinay (name changed), describing how his entire family makes a three-hour-long journey from , where they live to the medical college in Kanpur every month. 
,
,“My daughter depends on antiretroviral therapy given at the ART centre to keep living. We can’t afford the fare any longer. It would be better if the authorities establish a link centre at Bangarmau CHC itself,” said Vinay.
,
,His views were echoed by Sudarshan (name changed), a truck driver and a father of a 12-year-old HIV positive son. Residents of Chakmir, Sudarshan and his wife travel to Kanpur every month for treatment of their son and the bus ride costs Rs 800 per trip. 
,
,“The amount spent on travelling to the nearest ART centre should be reimbursed. Moreover, the government should set up a link centre here, else I would have no option but to skip treatment,” he said.
,
,Local social activists said what is worrying is that of the total 58 HIV positive cases identified so far during screening in the three villages, only 25 have visited the ART centre.
,
,“ART treatment can’t cure ,. There is still no outright cure for the disease, and it does not go away by itself. But ARTs do slow down the damage that the virus does to the immune system, and allow people to live long, productive lives like everyone else, without succumbing to the disease,” said an activist.
,
,A senior health official at ART centre, meanwhile, said there were several reasons why patients avoid medication. “They usually do not want to reveal their condition to their near and dear ones. Many skip the treatment out of the fear that others will find out about their condition,” he said. 
,
,At least 58 persons tested positive for HIV in Bangarmau after a quack allegedly used infected syringes to treat scores of his patients. Of these, 33 were detected at a blood donation camp on February 3 while 25 had come to light last year.

,Chennai has 46 Integrated , (ICTC), the highest in the state. Of this, 42 are under the Chennai Corporation and four are monitored directly by , AIDS Control Society (TANSACS). 
,
,However, with , featuring bottom-most in the city health department’s priority list -- following a drop in prevalence over the years -- counsellors at various ICTCs complain that lab technicians in these centers are often deputed to other departments in Corporation hospitals. “Screening is often affected in the process,” said a counsellor. “Patients are either asked to wait or return later, but they rarely do as most of them are part of a floating population,” she said. 
,
,The 42 ICTCs under corporation are managed by Chennai Corporation AIDS Prevention and Control Society (,), a body set up by National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) in the late 90s, along with similar city-wings in Mumbai and Ahmedabad. In 2016, NACO, following a decline in HIV prevalence in Ahmedabad and Chennai, wrote to the state AIDS control societies in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu asking them to merge the city-specific operations with the state.
,
,A senior official in TANSACS said of the Rs 69 crore the state receives every year from NACO, at least Rs 6.9 crore goes for paying salaries of around 100 CAPACS staff. “The department is cash-strapped right now with NACO slashing funds. CAPACS is an additional burden,” he said. 
,
,Besides, financial difficulties, officials say the merger will also benefit HIV patients. “Besides helping us monitor these centres better, we can also fill the vacancies by deputing staff from ICTCs in other districts where the prevalence is low,” he said. Another official said the city AIDS control society was set up at a time when these centers were available only in Chennai. “Now we have sufficient testing centers in the districts. The body is now obsolete,” he said.
,
,At present, there are 1,264 ICTCs and 55 antiretroviral therapy centers for HIV/AIDS people in Tamil Nadu. The state has 1.43 lakh people living with HIV and sees around 3,000-4,000 new cases a year. The state has a current prevalence rate of 0.28%, just above the national rate of 0.27%.

Now, he has to report to Kanpur ART Centre, 50 km away, for regular check-up and medication which is free.

,More than 12 years ago, their village had hit headlines for reporting a large number of HIV positive cases in a health camp. The incident had lent Udai Sarai a negative image, feel its residents, some of them relieved that the tag is now for Bangarmau’s villages. “Whenever I told people I was from Udai Sarai, they used to quickly check if it was the same HIV village that made news a few years ago. Though I was embarrassed, I had to accept the truth,” said former village head Dhanraj.
,
,“The Unnao villages’ incident is unfortunate,” he added, referring to the case where a quack had infected 58 people with a syringe. “But things will change if people determine. Take the case of our village, no new HIV case has been reported in Udai Sarai for a few years. This will help us shun the bad image,” he added.
,
,Awareness measures have helped Udai Sarai stay , for 5 years
,
,‘Women spearheading change by discussing prevention’
,
,In the detection in 2005, 52 people had tested positive for HIV. Of them, 48 have died while the remaining are on anti-retroviral therapy. The village, barely 18km from a government hospital, was home to around 500 families at that time. At least one member from each was working in Maharashtra or Gujarat. With migrant population believed to be a major reason for the virus, HIV came to be known as ‘Mumbai wali bimari’ here.
,
,Today, 90% of the 700 houses in the village have someone working in Maharashtra but no new case has been reported in the past five years.
,
,Women have driven the change by openly talking about prevention, claim health activists and officials. Caution has become their second nature.
,
,“Women maketheir husbands get themselves tested for HIV at least once a year,” said Vidya Devi, who was a newly wed in 2005. Anganwadi worker Gyan Swaroopa has been a hero of HIV prevention by counselling the women. Breaking barriers of shame and harassment—there is fear of being teased by men for talking
,
,about sex—she speaks openly to every boy who heads to Mumbai. “Isme kahekisharam... jaan hai to jahan hai (Why be ashamed of doing my duty. Health and survival are the most important),” she reasons.
,
,As a result, the air of stigma around HIV is absent in this village.
,
,“You can pose direct questions on HIV here unlike in other villages. In fact, HIV testing is considered even at the onset of a simplefever,” saidRajendra Sahu of Nehru Yuva Sangathan Tisi, a social organisation working to create awareness around HIV/ AIDS. Village head Jagatpal said: “The men have been told to have sex only with their wives. The elders keep an eye on the behaviour of their children. Those in Mumbai keep an eye on each other and ensure that no one gets deviated. Medical advice is taken for every disease. Even a simple fever is not ignored and HIV testing is done.”
,
,“No HIV positive case has been reported from this village in five years,” said Dr SP Jauhari, secretary of the district aids control society. However, HIV cases in Fatehpur district have continued to rise. Against 97 cases in 2014, 163 cases were reported in 2017. January alone this year has seen 27 cases, data from the health department shows.

,DAPCU programme officer , said that as many as 12,000 screenings have been conducted in the last 11 days in the rural and remote areas of the district. Shipurkar said those cases, which have been tested positive, have to undergo further tests to get the accurate result. 
,
,She added that these patients will be counselled at an integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC) before starting any treatment.
,
,According to Shipurkar, Kolhapur district has 3-4 major industrial areas besides the textile business of Ichalkaranji. These industrial enterprises are major hubs of employment generation. People from at least 100km periphery migrate to Kolhapur in search of jobs, most of who are HIV positive. 
,
,Another aspect unique to Kolhapur district is the seasonal migration of sugarcane cutters from ,, north , and , between October and April. DAPCU conducts regular awareness campaigns and screenings to find out prevalence of sexually-transmitted diseases among the sugarcane cutters, she said.
,
,At least one lakh people, mostly men, migrate to Kolhapur during the sugarcane cutting season. Previous reports have pointed out that unconventional working hours, heavy load, liquor consumption and unprotected sexual activity among a host of other factors others make them vulnerable to HIV.
,
,Shipurkar further said during ,, it has been found that people who travel to metro cities in search of work, contracted the virus there.
,
,She added all HIV positive patients should opt for Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) which they can avail at the four hospitals in the district. Patients are counselled at ICTCs before being administered treatment. After a range of blood tests, the patient whose CD4 count is less than 500, he has to take treatment throughout his life. 
,
,However, the norm has been relaxed now. The CD4 count is an indicator of how well the body's immune system is working.
,
,She added that it is a growing concern that the disease is more prevalent in the remote areas of the district. Awareness campaigns will be increased in the coming days.

Also, only 23.6% women and men knew how to prevent HIV/AIDS and another 20% had comprehensive knowledge. Divyang Oza, the project officer of the AIDS Control Society said that teenage groups are the most affected and the most common mode of infection was sexual transmission. The second strongest mode for HIV transmission is blood transfusion. It also cannot be denied that many couples only use condom for family planning and are unaware that it can be used to prevent HIV. Oza further said that HIV awareness has to be increased, but it is a time-consuming process and while there has been an improvement, it is less than expected.

,Out to open their own café called “Cafe Positive”, all they have met with for the last three months is a big negative. No house-owner in some of south Kolkata’s posh localities has been willing to rent out space once told about “who will manage and run the shop”.
,
,While a few landlords have straightaway refused saying “e paray erom cholbena (such business won’t run in this neighbourhood)”, others have been courteous enough with financial help and old clothes, but pleaded helplessness in renting out space to the 18-plus teens.

The owners initially seemed excited at the concept, but the moment they learnt that the shop will be managed and run solely by HIV-positive children, they backed out,” said ,, founder of Anandaghar, a shelter for abandoned HIV/AIDS-infected children.

It lists that denial or discontinuation of employment, education, healthcare services, renting or residing property, standing for public or private office will count as discrimination along with unfair treatment in any of the above mentioned categories.

It is under the ‘Viral load testing for all people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV)’ initiative launched by the Union ministry of health and family welfare on February 26 this year.

,The , selected in Bihar are at , (PMCH), Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) Patna and Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH), Muzaffarpur.
,
,Total 530 ART centres have been selected for free viral load testing of 12 lakh PLHIV on treatment in the country at least once a year.
,
,The central government has tied up with a private laboratory in Mumbai under public-private partnership (PPP) mode to provide viral load testing facility to patients across the country. A senior state health department official said samples would be collected from the three ART centres and flown to the Mumbai laboratory for test. “A hard copy of the report will be sent to the state,” he said.
,
,Human immunodeficiency virus (,) targets and destroys CD4 T cells that strengthen immunity in a person. Patients with a CD4 count below 200 are susceptible to develop serious illnesses. Viral load testing essentially tells whether the ART treatment regimen is working or not by measuring the amount of virus in a patient’s blood.
,
,“In more than 95% cases, the viral load becomes undetectable after six months of ART treatment. Earlier, the only test conducted to measure the effectiveness of treatment was to check the immune level (CD4 test) in a patient. Sometimes, the patient also becomes drug-resistant after treatment and thus the viral load increases. With viral load testing in government ART centres, it will be possible to detect the increase of the viruses in the blood of the patient after treatment,” a member of International AIDS Society, Dr Diwakar Tejaswi, said.
,
,There are only three private labs in Patna for collecting samples for viral load testing and they charge approximately Rs4000- 4500 for one test.

,CHANDIGARH: At the , (ART) centre of the , (Post Graduate Institute Of Medical Education and Research) for ,, you might notice a woman in her midforties, sitting in a corner, wearing a big smile, engaging in polite conservation with the visitors, scribbling down their profile. She is Meena Vij, who lost her husband to AIDS in 2004.
,
,She was in her second pregnancy in 1994 when she learnt she was HIV +ve. She aborted the child and confronted her husband, who ran a hotel. “After initial hesitance, he accepted his relationships with multiple partners,” said Meena, whose son is 27 now, and HIV negative.
, 
, 
,There was no ‘happily ever after’ in Meena’s life with her husband, but today she helps the people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Chandigarh find love. She has married off eight of them. Her face lights up at announcing that barring one, the rest of the couples are proud parents of HIV-negative children. “Of the myths about the disease, one is that the babies born to a mother with HIV also test positive,” Meena said. “People are unaware that if the mother and her baby receive proper medication during pregnancy and after birth, the chances of it are very less.”
,
,
,
,
,Meena is a member of the Chandigarh Network of People living with HIV/AIDS, or CNP+ for short. She is also a peer counsellor of Vihaan, a CNP+ programme. Network’s president Pooja Thakur was shunned by her in-laws when she tested positive along with her two sons a decade ago. Her eldest son, however, is HIV negative. Her husband died of AIDS. Pooja dared to go public about her HIV status in order to work for HIV awareness and counselling.
,
,Her positive attitude towards life rubbed on to several women and gave them the courage to live. One of them is today a member of Chandigarh State AIDS Control Society (SACS), CNP+, and Vihaan. She joined the network in 2007 after losing her husband to AIDS. She could move to Chandigarh with her four children because of a supportive brother.
,
,Created in November 2005, CNP+ meets on the 25th of every month, for tasks such as introducing new members, following up on the missed cases, and linking the members with ART centres. Today, the network has 1,000-plus registered members, who pay an annual subscription of Rs 100.
,
,CNP+ and Vihaan participate in many programmes of the state society. “We tell the PLHIV to visit the 12 integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTCs) in Chandigarh for free testing. We ask people to practice safe sex,” said Rahul, HIV+ve for more than 10 years.
,
,
,
,
,Meena said: “More important than fighting the disease is to fight the social stigma that keeps people from sharing their HIV status with family and taking treatment. We share our life stories with these people to boost their morale. We are living examples that with proper medication and diet, one can live with this virus for years,” said Meena, HIV +ve for 24 years.
,
,The PLHIVs live as outcasts. Family and friends discriminate against them, while even doctors judge them. Pooja asked for countrywide order for the doctors and clerks to write “universal precaution” instead of “HIV positive” on their hospital cards, “so that the chemists don’t look at us differently when they see the stamp”.
,
,
,
,
,“If our identity is revealed, our children won’t get admission in schools,” said a member of the network, seeking government support for a home for HIV-positive children and a higher monthly pension for widows and children from the present Rs 1,000 and Rs 700, respectively. Ask Pooja about the free bus pass in Chandigarh for PLHIVs and she has a hearty laugh. “For seven years, no progress,” she said.

Dr Sreelatha P R, pediatrics department, , said that the girl died of leukemia. “She was admitted to the hospital on Wednesday and her condition was very serious,” the doctor said.

,The girl’s father said she was taken to the RCC after the doctors at the MCH diagnosed her with leukemia in February, 2017. The treatment for leukemia began on March 1, 2017. While she was under treatment at RCC the girl underwent blood transfusion several times. The girl was tested positive for HIV in August, 2017. “On October 5, our child was taken to a lab in Chennai for a detailed HIV test. However, the lab report said she was not HIV positive. The doctors at RCC said it was not a final report and they can confirm the presence of HIV only after getting a report from Delhi. But the doctors have not given that report us till date,” he said.
,
,The girl’s father said she was discharged from the RCC on November 1last year. “After that she was never taken to the RCC. We followed ayurveda treatment. But it did not work her. She was under the treatment of doctors at Alappuzha MCH. On Wednesday, her condition became serious and we took her to the MCH. But she died,'' he said. The funeral will be held on Thursday.
,
,Dr Ramesh R, project director of the Kerala State AIDS Control Society (,), said the blood samples of the girl were tested in the lab of General Hospital, Tambaram in Chennai but the lab could not find viral load in her blood samples. “We forwarded the report to National AIDS Control Organization (,). They did not advice treatment for HIV as the Chennai lab could not find viral load. We were planning to conduct a repeat HIV test on her in CMC Vellore after some months,'' he said.
,
,The Medical College police in Thiruvananthapuram in September 2017 had registered case and launched a probe after receiving a complaint from the girl's parents in this regard. The KSACS, which conducted a probe into the incident, has given a clean chit to the RCC authorities and the report of the KSACS said that the blood given to the nine-yearold girl during transfusion at RCC in Thiruvananthapuram was tested before the procedure and HIV was not detected. Report of KSACS however pointed out that RCC was not equipped to detect the virus during the window period.

"Updated: Apr 23, 2018, 09:37 IST",Mystery cases of children testing HIV+ in Tamil Nadu rise,"CHENNAI: In 2017, 236 children below 18 years tested positive for HIV in the state, registering a near 25% decline in two years. While the number remains a concern for officials, what is worrying them even more is that they could not establish the source of the disease in 32 children, an increase of 10. This has led officials to believe that more children are engaging in highrisk sexual behavior or are victims of abuse.

,In 2015, of the 311 children who tested positive for HIV/ AIDS in the state, 289 contracted the infection from their HIV-infected mothers during pregnancy, labour or breastfeeding. Officials couldn’t establish the source of the infection in 22 children. Two years later, the number of parent-to-child transmission dipped along with the number of new cases detected among children, but the number of unaccounted cases touched 32, show data furnished by , in response to an RTI application by TOI.
, 
, 
,Officials and doctors say they suspect the mode of transmission of the infection among these children to be sexual as the increase is corroborated by an uptick in the number of children referred to government-run clinics for sexually transmitted infections. The number went up from 6,234 in 2015 to 8,871last year.
,
,Recognising the growing prevalence of STIs among children, TANSACS project director K Senthil Raj said he is in talks with the school education secretary to dedicate more space to sex education in the soon-to-be-introduced revamped textbooks.
,
,
,
,
,He said staff at the integrated counselling and testing centers (ICTC) for HIV usually maintain a record of children with the infection, including those who haven’t got it from infected mothers. “They usually don’t probe. But if they do find the reason during the counselling, they maintain it in their notebooks,” he said. Some of the children, he said, could have acquired it through blood transfusion or injectable drugs.
,
,Consultant psychiatrist Dr M Suresh Kumar, who has worked extensively with injection drug users, rules out this possibility. “Heroin and other synthetic injectable opioids were popular till the late 90s. We haven’t been seeing young heroin addicts in a while,” saidDr Kumar.Hisobservation is backed by official data: Of the 1.43 lakh people living withHIVin TNcovered under the central-sponsored prevention programme, 56 are users of injectibles. All are in their 40s and above. Dr Kumar saidthey are,however, seeing other kinds of addictions, including marijuana and alcohol,on the rise among youngsters. “It is known that high drug use can make you vulnerable to engaging in high-risksexualbehavior,” he noted.
,
,HIV specialist Dr S Sundar observed that the state should expand its HIV/AIDS prevention programme to youngsters who aren’t part of the traditional “high-risk” group. “All our programmes are targeted at the high-risk population like female sex workers, transgenders, men who have sex with men and truck drivers. But ask a counsellor at an ICTC who he or sheseesthe most–itisusually people who are not part of this group,” hesaid. “Children are engaging in sexual activity belowthelegal ageof consent. It is a fact. They could be in a situation where nobody will even ask for consent,” added Sundar.
,
,Whatever be the source, once diagnosed, these children are forced to battle the stigma associated with the infection or live in the fear that someone may find out they are positive, said P Manorama, former chairperson of Child Welfare Committee, Chennai, who runs an organisation that works with children withHIV. Shesaidshe receives at least one child trafficking victim a year who tests positivefor HIVlinkedto sexualexploitation. “Butthey remain mere names in the state’s medical records. Officials don’t investigate further,” saidManorama, adding that TANSACS should coordinate with other departments to tackle these cases.

"May 4, 2018, 06:20 IST",‘11 blood units found HIV-infected in ’17’,"LUCKNOW:In 2017, as many as 11units of blood donated at the community blood bank of King George’s Medical University (,) were found to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In past several years, only three to five units of , infected blood units had been timely detected annually.

,The rise implies that the number of HIV infected persons are increasing, and also that KGMU has been able to detect infected blood with much more precision by using the specialized Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT), than the previously used ELISA testing method to check donated blood for preventing infections via blood transfusion. Speaking at a programme on ‘Safe Blood Transfusion: Need of the Hour’, head of transfusion medicine department at KGMU, Prof Tulika Chandra said, “Blood transfusion runs a direct risk of contracting HIV if the blood is infected. We at KGMU have undertaken , since 2012. Since then, of the 3,10,000 units tested by NAT, 2,300 were found to be infected with HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C and were thus discarded.”
,
,
,
,But, it is not just 2,300 lives, that KGMU claims to have saved, depending on just conducting NAT on blood. “NAT helped save more than 9,000 lives by detecting 2,300 infected blood units that were discarded since four blood components would have been segregated from each unit, which equals to four patients and any one of this unit can be infected,” said Prof Chandra.
,
,She added that the number of HIV infected blood units has grown exponentially while cases of blood infected with Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B have gone down over the years.
,
,“There is an urgent need for blood transfusions to be made safe and the government should take note of this fact. Infected blood can be fatal if transfused to an ailing person. There is a phenomena called horizontal transfusion, which means that a person, transfused with infected blood, can give the infection to others in family through sexual and sometimes other means,” she added.
,
,Prof Chandra added that KGMU and SGPGIMS are the only centres using NAT while other government hospitals are still using the ELISA testing method.
,
,ELISA detects antibodies or antigens produced months after an infection is contracted and is thus futile for recent infections. NAT on the other hand, directly detects DNA or RNA of the infection causing virus present in the blood, making it more accurate.

,“A two-day workshop of stakeholders was conducted in Ahmedabad on May 14 and 15 which was supported by WHO. Each partnering UN agency will focus on different aspects of the issue. For example, WHO will work on AIDS ART centres whereas UNODC will focus on de-addiction and so on,” he said, adding that now TB eradication has also been taken up along with the work for HIV+. Dr Gopal added that they have devised a plan to reach out to different regions and different groups of persons living with HIV+ in tailor-made way for effective implementation of the project.

This is a significant improvement from a decade ago, when over two HIV+ cases were recorded per day.

, 
, 
,
,While men constituted 60% of the total number of HIV+ cases in the first trimester of this year, no transgenders and transsexuals were detected with the condition for the second year in a row. 
,
,Mormugao continued to be the taluka with the highest number of HIV+ cases (27%), while Salcete came in second at 16%. Bardez, the taluka that had in the past years reported the second-highest and, sometimes, highest number of HIV+ cases in the state, accounted for only six of the total cases in the first three months of 2018. No new cases were reported from Sattari, Sanguem and Canacona.
,
,The predominant mode of transmission of HIV has continued to be the sexual route, with over 90% of such cases reported. Transmission modes involving infected syringes, needles, blood and blood products have been negligible in the state.
,
,Although five deaths due to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were reported in January and February this year, chief medical officer of the Goa State AIDS Control Society (GSACS), Dr Chandrakant Parab, said the launch of the ‘test and treat’ policy last April is expected to reduce the number of AIDS-related deaths further. Under the policy, anyone diagnosed as an HIV+ patient is put on antiretroviral therapy (ART), irrespective of the clinical stage or CD4 count—a snapshot of how the patient’s immune system is functioning. In the past, ART, which suppresses the activity of the HIV retrovirus, was recommended only in cases where it was considered necessary.
,
,Since the implementation of the ‘test and treat’ policy, more than 370 HIV+ persons have been put on ART in a phased manner in the state. 
,
,“ART, which can slow down the rate at which HIV weakens the immune system, is now administered to everybody: Men, women, adolescents and children,” Parab said, pointing out that the move is expected to keep their immune system strong and healthy and improve their longevity and quality of life. 
,
,Parab said the elimination of stigma is vital to ensure that people who have the slightest doubt of their status voluntarily come forward to get tested and seek treatment. “Those indulging in risky behaviour must also protect themselves, as HIV is 100% preventable,” he added.

,
,Every donated unit of blood is tested for diseases such as HIV and , viruses. The ones with infections are called, counselled and put through another round of HIV-testing. But in Mumbai there is a gap between numbers who test positive and those who return for counselling and treatment, said MDACS officials.
,
,In 2016-17, 0.29% of the blood from banks was positive for HIV. Given the new WHO call to put every HIV-positive person on treatment at the earliest to ensure a better quality of life, MDACS increased efforts to find HIV-positive persons and start them on treatment.
,
,It issued a circular on June 5 advising blood banks on how to take the history of blood donors and how to counsel them. Blood banks have to retest any blood unit that tests positive for HIV and call the donor for a retest and counselling session at the nearest government-run Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC). “But in practice, such donors never return to the centres. There is a significant gap between positive sample detected and donors who return for a confirmation,"" said asenior doctor.
,
,MDACS additional project director Dr Shrikala Acharya has written that in collaboration with American Center’s for Diseases Control, India has initiated an exercise to assess reasons for this discordance. “It has also been decided that such donors should be referred to any ICTC they are comfortable to visit,"" said Dr Acharya.

"Jun 11, 2018, 11:02 IST",HIV vaccine comes closer to reality,"WASHINGTON DC: , vaccine could soon be a reality.

,
,Researchers have found that Treg cells, a type of regulatory lymphocyte, might be protecting babies in the womb from getting infected with the HIV virus when the mother is infected.
,
,""Finding out what protects the majority of babies is important, as it can lead to ways to boost natural immune responses and make individuals resistant to HIV infection,"" said researcher Peter Kessler from the , School of Medicine.
,
,Scientists had been puzzled for years by the fact that only a minority of babies born to mothers with HIV infection get the infection from their mothers. 
,
,Currently, HIV infection can be successfully managed with antiretroviral drugs, but these drugs have to be given for life. Preventing the infection is very important, but there is no vaccine available yet.
,
,Researchers found that levels of Treg lymphocytes were higher in the blood of newborn babies born to mothers with HIV infection who had escaped the infection themselves, compared with babies who were born with HIV infection.
,
,Lymphocytes are cells of the immune system that protect the body by fighting bacteria and viruses. Treg cells, or regulatory T cells, are an important ""self-check"" in the immune system to prevent excessive immune reactions that could lead to tissue damage.
,
,The researchers examined the blood of 64 babies who were born HIV-uninfected and 28 babies born HIV-infected and found that , levels were higher in uninfected babies at the time of birth. In contrast, other lymphocyte types were activated and higher in HIV-infected infants. The HIV virus can only infect cells that are activated, so Treg may protect from HIV infection by suppressing activation of other lymphocytes.
,
,They analyzed the stored blood by flow cytometry, a technique that can differentiate between the different types of cells based on what markers they express on their surface. Regulatory T cells come in many forms with the most well-understood being those that express the markers CD4, CD25, and FOXP3.
,
,""Even though the number of babies studied is relatively small, these findings indicate that Treg, by controlling immune activation, may lower the vulnerability of the babies to HIV or other chronic infections even before they are born,"" said Kessler.
,
,These results could pave the way for the development of vaccines or other immune-based therapies that could be used together with medications to prevent the spread of HIV or other infections from mothers to their babies.

,
,Along with this, there are even plans to open a single window for licensing in the JMC office as the complaints of the public towards the authorities related to the issue of licensing for dairy booths are rising in number. 
,
,This plan is made to keep a check on the officials so that problem will not be created for the general public. Jaipur city is divided into eight zones and at present in every zone a junior engineer (JEN) look after the matter but after the implementation of single window, soon two JEN and two clerks will look after the matters of four zones each in the office to be allotted in the JMC.

,
,Since little over a month, 16 children aged between six months and two years are being given pellets, which look like homeopathy pills, containing drugs lopinavir and ritonavir. The pellets, that can be sprinkled over food too, have already proven to be advantageous, in terms of administration. The ,, which used to be the main alternative for paediatric patients, was met with a lot of resistance as it left a bitter aftertaste and children would often spit it out.
,
,The centre at Sion hospital will be documenting the efficacy and acceptance of the oral pellets, along with the other centres. “So far, the response has been positive. Earlier, parents would return with the syrup bottles and say it was unpalatable,” said Dr Yashwant Gabhale, head of the paediatric centre at Sion. Additionally, a decrease in side-effects has also been seen. “Problems such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been minimal, so far,” he added. 
,
,There are nearly 76,000 children living with HIV in the country of which 5,000-odd are from Maharashtra. The use of oral pellets has been restricted to children up to two years of age for now. While the national programme incorporated children since 2006, it was only by late 2007 that paediatric formulations were available. Former paediatric head of Sion hospital Dr Mamata Manglani said that children were initially given adult medication till syrups came into the national programme. “However, there were logistical and storage issues with syrups that paved the way for dispensable tablets over time,” she said. 
,
,Finding pharmaceutical companies to make child-friendly formulations has always been a challenge, say NACO experts, who hope to scale up once the paediatric centres present their feedback and there are more suppliers. “Currently, Cipla is the only company that is making oral pellet formulation. Mylan is likely to start producing it next,” said NACO’s Dr RS Gupta. He said the introduction of pellets is likely to make a big difference in adherence. “Gulping pills every day is a struggle in itself. It becomes more difficult for babies,” he said. Doctors say the overall adherence among children is more than 90%, till their parents are giving them the medicines. 
,
,A parent TOI spoke to said oral pellets are undoubtedly easy to administer. “We only hope that it is regularly available and the supply is uninterrupted since there are limited manufacturers,” he said. Not too long ago, the syrup was in short supply across the country.

"Updated: Jul 20, 2018, 15:06 IST",India sees major reductions in HIV infections: UN report,"UNITED NATIONS: India saw a major reduction in the number of new HIV infections, AIDS-related deaths and people living with HIV from 2010 to 2017 on the back of sustained and focussed efforts, according to a UN report which warned that the epidemic was growing in Pakistan.

,The , (UNAIDS) report titled 'Miles to go -- closing gaps, breaking barriers, righting injustices' said Asia and the Pacific regions have made strong inroads with its HIV response.
,
,Sustained and focused efforts to reach key populations have led to major reductions in HIV infections in Cambodia, India, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam between 2010 and 2017.
,
,The report, however, warned that the global new HIV infections were not declining fast enough. It also noted that the epidemics were expanding in Pakistan and the Philippines.
,
,In India, new HIV infections dropped from 120,000 in 2010 to 88,000 in 2017, AIDS-related deaths from 160,000 to 69,000 and people living with HIV from 2,300,000 to 2,100,000 in the same time period, the report said.
,
,India has an approved social protection strategy, policy or framework that is being implemented, it said.
,
,Successive surveys in Cambodia, India, Thailand and Vietnam also indicate that attitudes towards people living with HIV have improved creating safer working conditions for sex workers and engaging them closely in the design and implementation of programmes make a huge difference, it said.
,
,The report underscored the public health benefits of decriminalising sex work.
,
,It found that countries that had decriminalised at least some aspects of sex work have fewer sex workers living with HIV than countries that criminalise all aspects of sex work.
,
,Modelling based on data from Canada, India and Kenya indicates that the decriminalisation of sex work could avert 33-46 per cent of HIV infections over the course of a decade.
,
,The report cited the example of Karnataka, where advocacy work with senior police officials, sensitisation workshops and the inclusion of HIV and human rights topics in pre-service curricula led to significant decreases in the arrest of female sex workers, especially during police raids.
,
,Before the interventions, half (50 per cent) of the 4,110 surveyed female sex workers said they had been arrested or detained at some point during police raids, that proportion shrank to 20 per cent after the interventions, the report said.
,
,Referring to the initiative sponsored by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to reduce the spread of HIV in India, the report said the Avahan programme in Karnataka and other States remained a ""sterling example"" of the impact of combining condom programming with community empowerment and structural improvements that tackle stigma, violence and unsafe working environments.
,
,UNAIDS, however, issued a stark wake-up call for nations, warning that the global response to HIV is at a precarious point.
,
,At the halfway point to the 2020 targets, the report warned that the pace of progress was not matching global ambition.
,
,""We are sounding the alarm"", said Michel Sidibe, Executive Director of UNAIDS.
,
,""Entire regions are falling behind, the huge gains we made for children are not being sustained, women are still most affected, resources are still not matching political commitments and key populations continue to be ignored. All these elements are halting progress and urgently need to be addressed head-on,"" Sidibe said.
,
,Global new HIV infections have declined by just 18 per cent in the past seven years, from 2.2 million in 2010 to 1.8 million in 2017, the report noted.
,
,Although this is nearly half the number of new infections compared to the peak in 1996 (3.4 million), the decline is not quick enough to reach the target of fewer than 500,000 by 2020.
,
,In 2017, an estimated 36.9 million people globally were living with HIV and 21.7 million people were accessing treatment, it said.
,
,The report also shows that key populations are not being considered enough in HIV programming.
,
,Key populations and their sexual partners account for 47 per cent of the new HIV infections worldwide and 97 per cent of new HIV infections in eastern Europe and central Asia, where one third of new HIV infections are among people who inject drugs.
,
,""The right to health for all is non-negotiable,"" said Sidibe.
,
,""Sex workers, gay men and other men who have sex with men, prisoners, migrants, refugees and transgender people are more affected by HIV but are still being left out from HIV programmes. More investments are needed in reaching these key populations,"" Sidibe added.

,What made Avahan a successful model was that it never took a moral and judgemental view, says H L Mohan, managing trustee, Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT), who spearheaded the project. 
,
,According to a Lancet report, Avahan prevented no less than six lakh HIV cases in India. Karnataka was one of the six states chosen for the project, and here, it was executed by KHPT from 2003 to 2012. 
,
,The programme not only brought in mandatory condom usage but also worked for the community members’ empowerment. Clinics were set up where members went for fortnightly tests. The project also helped them save money in cooperative societies run by themselves. Drop-in centres were established at the hotspots, where sex workers could walk in at any time to relax, watch TV and consult doctors. In Bengaluru, the centres were set up in Yeshwantpur, Shivajinagar and Malleswaram and were functional 24/7.
,
,With every fortnightly visit, members of the vulnerable section understood the complexity of the situation they were in. “We set up cooperative societies run by sex workers, so that they can save money and don’t have to borrow from money lenders. We have even saved many young girls from being trafficked,” said Mohan.
,
,In 2013, when the project ended, the centres were subsumed with the government. “Avahan should have been an ongoing project to make the state HIV-free,” added Mohan. Even now, KHPT gets visitors from abroad who come to study the model that led to HIV prevention.
,
,No mean feat
,
,To win the confidence of sex workers and work with them in risk-reduction interventions wasn’t easy to begin with. Usage of condoms alone wouldn’t have worked unless we reduced their vulnerability. We had to closely work with them to understand the strategy to safeguard them from infections. We did a hotspot mapping involving them. The strategy was different for each district. While home-based prostitution was seen more in districts like Shivamogga, street-based work was more prevalent in places like Davanagere, Ballari and Bengaluru

"Updated: Aug 8, 2018, 12:03 IST",Relief for HIV patients: They can now take home 3 months’ drugs,"MUMBAI: For people living with ,, receiving medicines is as much of a challenge as keeping the virus in check. Every once a month, the person must seek leave from the workplace, arrive early in the morning to a hospital, beat the crowds and queue up for hours to collect the antiretroviral medicines. 

, For a section of people living with HIV, this situation will soon change. In a first, the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) has decided to give patients the medicine stock for 90-days at a time. Currently, most patients are handed stocks for a month, and in rare instances, for two months. People living with HIV have long wanted this option, which has been tried with success in several African countries.
,
, Termed as Differentiated Service Delivery Model (DSDM), it has already been rolled out at ten centres across the country, including KEM Hospital in Parel. Patients, though, will have to meet several criteria to be eligible for DSDM. “Primarily, it will be given to those who have been on treatment for at least a year and have 95% adherence rate. The individual has to be clinically fit and free of any side-effects and opportunistic infections (such as tuberculosis) at the time of enrolment,” said Dr RS Gupta, deputy director, NACO. “Besides making it easier for patients, it will also help to decongest the ART centres,” he added. 
,
, At KEM, over 500 patients have already been identified and enrolled into the programme. The Parel hospital caters to over 1500 people living with HIV. “Patients often have problems seeking frequent leaves from their workplace. This initiative will save them repeated visits only for drug refill. It will also save travel costs,” said Dr Srikala Acharya, assistant project director at the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS). She added that only patients on the first line of treatment and CD4 count (a vital parameter) of more than 500 will be considered for DSDM. 
,
, Besides Mumbai’s KEM, centres at Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Benaras, and designated hospitals in Manipur, Bhagalpur and Raipur are rolling out the initiative. Talking to TOI, a person living with HIV hailed the model and said it was long-awaited and will go a long way in making life easy for patients. “Most HIV-affected people continue to live in anonymity. It, therefore, becomes difficult to explain in offices why one needs to leave every month on fixed days,” said the 42-year-old central Mumbai resident. 
,
, Members of the civil society too have welcomed the decision but cautioned that support systems have to be strengthened for the model to succeed. “It’s a great initiative particularly for patients who have to visit resource-strapped health facilities. In Mumbai, 17 ART centres cater to nearly 35000 patients. Decongestion of these centres will allow counsellors to spend more time with patients,” said HIV activist Ganesh Acharya. However, he said for DSDM to succeed, counselling facilities must be enhanced.
,
, Echoing the same, Sachin Awasthi from Vihaan, a patients’ group that works towards improving adherence, said that the monthly meeting with counsellors and caregivers play an important role. “We have to ensure that patients don’t start taking their regimes casually,” he said.

Police alleged that the accused killed the child after suspecting that he too was , positive like his wife, daughter and himself.

,
, Observing that the homicidal death of the child was not proved, the sessions court also did not find the alleged motive convincing. ""It is not believable that when his wife and daughter are suffering from HIV and they were taking treatment at a civil hospital in Jalna, then merely on suspicion that the deceased might be suffering from HIV, he would take such a drastic step of taking the life of his son,"" the court said.

,The accused and his wife had six children. The accused had been in jail from July 11, 2016. The prosecution stated that on July 5, 2016, the son was crying so the accused took him out. The prosecution said after there no trace of the father and the son, the woman appproached the police at 4am the next day, and later the accused called her on her phone and said he had killed their son.

,An initiative of GSNP+, the website has financial support from SRK Knowledge Foundation and technical support from IIM-A. IIM-A director Errol D’Souza said the website represented a progressive step. He said that field surveys indicate that the number of people living with HIV is higher than official estimates.Daksha Patel, the founder of GSNP+, said that about 16 lakh people live with HIV in India. “In Gujarat, 68,000 persons regularly visit ART (antiretroviral therapy) centres,” she said.
,
,“The actual number — including those taking treatment at private centres —might be higher. With the rise in longevity thanks to modern treatment, there has been an increase in demand for matrimony services. However, this matrimony service works way differently from the standard ones.” GSNP has so far organised six major meetings for prospective brides and grooms living with HIV and has been instrumental in 245 weddings in about a decade. The registered members for matrimony are about 1,900.

,It was Rasik Bhuva’s case that became instrumental in starting the matrimony service and eventually the website for GSNP+. “I was diagnosed with HIV soon after my engagement. I was quick to break the relationship off citing health issues,” said Bhuva. “When I started counselling HIV patients, I met a girl from , and we tied the knot.”
,

,The board invited curious stares and subjected the family to humiliating questions. No sooner they found out about the board, the patient’s children decided not to dare enter the ward for fear of being discriminated at the educational institutions where they study. Other members of the family were in tears trying to fend off unwanted questions.

The reason: the national programme focuses on medicines instead of a comprehensive medical, nutritional and psychosocial model.

A fourth of India’s 60,000-odd children taking ART for HIV live in ,. With no adequate support, the state recently learned that over 30,000 of the two lakh patients on treatment have quietly dropped out.
,
,
,
,
,Sumana looks like a 10-year-old though she’s a teenager 11 months shy of 18. Four feet tall and with body weight of 30kg, she is at least 25kg underweight and significantly short for her age. Her mental ability is of a child half her age and she is hearing impaired.
,
,At Solapur’s Palawi-Prabha Hira Pratishthan, one of Maharashtra’s oldest institutions caring for children living with HIV, cases like Sumana’s are not an exception. At least 60% of the 110 children here suffer from varying degrees of hearing loss. The prevalence of height and weight stunting is more than 70%, while over a third have stymied mental development. Besides physical, prevalence of mental health problems such as depression is alarmingly high.
,
,AIDS-related deaths have dropped by 54% and new infections by 66% in India over a decade, but children like Sumana are a testimony to the gaping deficit in the national programme that focuses on drugs instead of a holistic medical, nutritional and psychosocial model that a complex disease such as HIV warrants. A little over a quarter of the 60,000 such children are in Maharashtra.
,
,An otherwise spirited child, Sumant gets drowsy and irritable after taking medicines. “I get severe stomach-ache, dizziness, headache and diarrhoea,'' he says, describing his plight after taking the daily dose of antiretroviral therapy (ART) medicines. Born with the virus, these children need to take two to six capsules daily. For additional infections such as tuberculosis, the pill count could run into double digits. Their very survival depends on following this regimen, but the six-year-old Sumant is among 17 children at the Palawi home who refuse to continue with ART .
,
,“Children go through hell in spite of ART. There is no denying the dramatic shift in HIV care today, but what about those who got the disease at the turn of the century and have spent a lifetime taking medicines. We know little or nothing about what the virus or ART does to each child?” said Palawi's founder, 65-year-old Mangaltai Shah. She says most children in Palawi grapple with problems ranging from skin rashes, oral and vaginal yeast infections, pus accumulation in ears, hearing and vision problems to life-threatening infections such as TB. “So when medicines meant to heal start giving additional trouble, they find it easier to discard.” Moreover, she adds, at Rs 25 per child per day institutions like Palawi neither have adequate funds nor support from government hospitals to tackle the unique health problems of each child.
,
,Sumant is supposed to receive intensive counselling from the local ART centre till his adherence improves, but Shah says the three doctors and four counsellors that cater to 300 HIV patients daily at , Civil Hospital barely have the time to look up. For nearly 3 lakh registered HIV patients in the state, there are less than 1,000 counsellors. Another Palawi resident, four-year-old Khusboo, suffered hearing loss after recurrent ear infections. The diagnosis didn't come from the ART centre, but from her teacher at Palawi’s in-house Gyan Mandir school, who noticed Khusboo was oblivious to classroom activities.
,
,The institution was compelled to start its own school in 2014—a ground-plus-one structure next to the orphanage on Pandharpur’s outskirts—as children are denied admission in regular schools the moment Palawi is mentioned. But it’s a blessing in disguise for these children who struggle to sit through more than one or two classes without dozing off. “A regular school wouldn’t understand or probably tolerate it,” Patil says. Palawi which has been home to 250 HIV-positive children since 2001, has lost 40 to the disease. AIDS claims an average of 2,500 lives in Maharashtra annually; how many are children is not known. The state recently discovered that over 30,000 of the two lakh patients on treatment have dropped out. Here too, paediatric percentage is unclear. On paper, 16,000 children in Maharashtra are on treatment.
,
,Coping is equally challenging for children in the community, who having lost one or both parents to the virus, face vulnerabilities starting from poor access to healthcare and government entitlements to education and nutrition.
,
,Now 17, Palghar native Sachin has been on ART since he was three. He lost his mother at birth and father last December to HIV. He admits to skipping his daily 10-pill regimen. He dropped out of school due to his condition. “The pain would begin after the morning pills. I would cry in class and be compelled to lie down,” said Sachin who can't keep a job either as the medicines make him “drowsy and tired”. At four-feet and grossly underweight at 35kg, Sachin typifies the wasting and stunting associated with HIV.
,
,HIV is a neurotropic virus that not just attacks the immune system but practically affects every organ, resulting in damage to nerve tissues, cognitive development, physical growth, and at the same time causing learning difficulties, speech and language problems. Experts say it’s crucial to monitor toxicity and provide 360-degree healthcare. Dr Ira Shah, an expert in paediatric HIV, says it’s not enough to tell children to take medicines lifelong. “These are toxic drugs given at a much younger age. It is necessary to monitor bone health or metabolic acidosis before the children become intolerant,” she said. In one of her published papers, she wrote about three children who died of neurological complications caused by HIV despite their viral load being suppressed with drugs.
,
,National Aids Control Organisation deputy director Dr R S Gupta admits little is known about how children cope with ART. But he underlines the fact that “they live longer because of the medicines and the average life expectancy now exceeds 20.” There are side-effects, but “what is important is they are alive”. Ironically, Sumant, Khusboo, Sachin are Indian HIV programme's success stories even though they are not thriving but merely surviving.

"Sep 4, 2018, 06:36 IST","With no disclosure norms, most HIV+ kids learn about ailment after parent’s death","SOLAPUR: Throughout her childhood, 14-year-old Mona would overhear terms such as ‘HIV’ and ‘AIDS’ uttered in hushed tones at her Solapur house. The mystery ended two years ago when her mother succumbed to , following a ten-year battle.

,Her bedridden father, also afflicted by the virus, broke the news to her just a day later. “It’s a germ in our blood that will stay with us forever. It has not spared you either,” says Mona, recalling her father’s words. The revelation, she vividly remembers, was followed by a directive to keep it a secret. More than the disease, it was the secrecy that instilled a deep sense of shame.
,
,Similarly, Pandharpur native Sundari (13) barely had time to cope with her father’s death when she was told about her , status. That was the first time her grandfather told her that it was AIDS that killed her parents. Unable to bear the ill-treatment meted out to her by the extended family, the grandfather put her in an orphanage, where she presently lives.
,
,Studies have underlined the criticality of disclosure—telling someone about their HIV status—in fighting the disease and how, when done under tragic circumstances and without counselling, it can damage the way an HIV-infected child or an adolescent view themselves for the rest of their lives. The lack of a holistic framework in India has left parents, caregivers and institutions grappling to find the right approach. Several children discover the ailment accidentally or at the time of losing a parent; many come to know when they are being discriminated against, or worse, after they have been sexually abused. 
,
,The complex questions of ‘how to tell’ and ‘when to tell’ is simply passed over at ,, one of the oldest homes in Maharashtra to care for HIV positive children. The caretakers never let out the “secret” even as they teach every child how to take medicines and fight the disease. “If they have questions about HIV, we answer them scientifically,” said Shirish Lawate, trustee of Manavya. Children as young as five start questioning their daily medications. “We tell them it’s to kill the jantu (organism) inside their body,” says Sushma Apte, one of the coordinators. 
,
,Visits to hospitals and ART centres seem to be one of the common ways children discover their HIV status. Fifteen-year-old Sushila says, “I figured I had HIV by looking at posters at Solapur Civil Hospital. But it took me a while to understand there are ways other than physical relationships to get HIV,” she says. The teenager is from ,, a residential institution run by Mangaltai Shah and her daughter Dimple Ghadge that provides shelter to 110 HIV children. Ghadge says counselling at state-run ART centres is perfunctory. “That’s perhaps the reason why mental health issues, particularly depression, mood swings and anger is rampant among them,” says Ghadge. 
,
,Chinmayi Modi, a member of the National Coalition of People living with HIV India (NCPI+), adds that the incidence of suicides among HIV-affected youth is high but there is no verifiable data. 
,
,At the Bandra-based CCDT, for in-house residents older than 10-12 years, the disclosure is done gradually keeping the child’s maturity in mind. It’s when families are involved, says programme director Poonam DSouza, that it becomes challenging. “All parents want to delay it till their children are in late teens,” she says. “But we discourage late disclosures since children at that age start having relationships and should be aware of the risks of unsafe sex,” she adds. Brahmadev from Vihaan, an NGO working for HIV, says it’s common for children to blame parents, run away from home and stop taking medicines. 
,
,Unlike practices worldwide, where a lot of thought goes into disclosing a child’s HIV status, no structure exists here, says Shabana Patel, president of Network of Maharashtra People with HIV (NMP+). ""The first counselling when a child starts ART is crucial and should last for a minimum of 45 minutes. Unfortunately, it doesn't happen even for 5 minutes,"" says Patel. In Maharashtra, there is one counsellor for every 300 HIV patients. Parimal Singh, who heads Maharashtra State Aids Control Society, said a methodology is being drawn up to ensure those who have adherence issues don't miss out on quality counselling. 
,
,Mumbai’s Sion Hospital has developed some tools for this purpose. Counsellor Laxman Jamkhandi uses storytelling to educate his young patients. White cells vital to the immune system assume the role of good soldiers that need the aid of weapons like ART drugs and nutrition to kill the black demon virus. “A superhero story never fails to get the attention of children,"" he says. ""With better ART, children are surviving for decades, so it's better their body and mind starts accepting it early.”

The laboratory also gets dried blood spot samples from Gujarat, Goa and Madhya Pradesh. “Such a delay is unfortunate as the advances in ART assure that children with HIV escape the serious neurological damages,” she said.
,
,Nair hospital’s Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre has found migration to be one of the biggest reasons. “In 70% of these cases, parents are migrants, who come here for child delivery and return to their hometowns. In a small percentage, it’s also the lack of understanding about the seriousness of HIV,” said Medha Deorukhkar, a counsellor at the centre. Around 46% of children were lost to follow-up, the analysis found. 
,
,The national protocol warrants that babies be followed up to 18 months as antibodies from mother could give out false positivity in tests carried out before that. In fact, regular follow-ups and counselling are crucial not just for HIV-positive babies, but also for negative ones. While India data is scarce, it has been found that babies who have escaped contracting the virus during birth may still get it through breastfeeding. “Counselling is crucial as mothers may not comprehend the harm of switching between breast milk to formula milk,” said a doctor from Sion hospital’s paediatric centre of excellence for HIV. “Bottle feeds cause ulceration on the gut wall, which makes it conducive for the virus to enter the baby’s bloodstream.” 
,
,Dr Shikala Acharya, assistant project director at Mumbai District Aids Control Society, said while mother-to-child transmission has dropped to less than 0.2%, tracking remains a challenge. In 2017-18, of around 460 deliveries in HIV-positive women, four babies tested positive. She said in families where the couple has not informed extended family, pursuing them to return for testing of the child becomes difficult. 
,
,But Dr Anju Seth, director of paediatrics at Delhi’s Lady Hardinge Medical College, said it’s worth the effort as virus suppression is crucial here. “The first three years of a child’s life is when maximum growth happens. If the virus is not controlled, damages like stunting of height, weight and developmental milestones could be permanent.”

,Halappa KB, 60, and Sushmitha, 21, are residents of Davanagere. Halappa, a labourer, got admitted to City Central Hospital in December 2017 for acute leg pain, followed by blockage in his veins. He alleged that no consent was taken from him for the HIV test nor was he informed while his blood was being drawn. His son Raju H is now running from pillar to post seeking justice and has complained to the consumer court as well, claiming that his father had to face stigma due to the false positive reports.
,
,“The hospital conducted an HIV test without our knowledge and consent. It claimed that the report was positive and refused to conduct cardiac surgery on my father. He slipped into depression and even attempted suicide. We brought him to a private hospital in Bengaluru and got him tested for HIV. But the report was negative and he even underwent the operation. My complaint to the health department has been ignored and justice has been delayed,” Raju told TOI. 
,
,Sushmitha had visited the , in March for a prenatal check-up when she was five months pregnant. “The blood test was done on March 23. But they asked us to collect the report after three days. We were shocked with the findings — they showed she was HIV-positive — and underwent stress and psychological trauma,” said her husband Prahlad S, a police constable.
,
,The couple then went to the government-run Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre for HIV testing. Till then, they had no idea that the report issued by the private hospital was false. “ICTC’s report revealed Sushmitha was not HIV-positive, which came as a huge relief. But the private hospital was firm on its stand. If they had a doubt, they should have conducted another test,” said Prahlad. Sushmitha’s medical negligence complaint with the health department is pending inquiry. Prahlad added that the hospital didn’t even bother to counsel them when they were traumatised after seeing the report.
,
,Dr Raghavan GD, district HIV/AIDS control officer, Davanagere, said he was asked by the district health officer to inquire into both the complaints. “In Halappa’s case, the inquiry report has been submitted to the government, but the findings can’t be disclosed. In the other case, the inquiry is yet to begin,” he said.

"Oct 19, 2018, 09:51 IST","A blue pill is stopping HIV like never before, study shows","SYDNEY: An antiviral pill taken daily by thousands of men across Sydney and other parts of Australia led to a globally unprecedented reduction in new , cases, showing that a targeted, preventative approach may accelerate progress on ending the , epidemic.

,New cases of HIV among gay and bisexual men fell by almost a third to the lowest on record, according to the world’s first study to measure the impact of Gilead Sciences Inc's , pill on reducing the AIDS-causing virus in a large population. The results, published Thursday in the Lancet HIV medical journal, may pave the way for other states and countries to stop transmission of the virus with the use of a treatment called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP.
,
,""The speed of the decline we’ve seen in new HIV infections in gay and bisexual men is a world first,"" said study leader Andrew Grulich, head of HIV epidemiology and prevention at the Kirby Institute of the University of New South Wales. ""These numbers are the lowest on record since HIV surveillance began in 1985.""
,
,Progress against AIDS over the past 15 years has inspired a commitment by UN member states to end the epidemic by 2030. The number of people newly infected with HIV fell to 1.8 million worldwide in 2017, from more than 3 million a year through most of the 1990s. While the study results can’t be generalized to indicate similar efficacy in heterosexual populations, they do demonstrate that PrEP is ""highly cost-effective"" in certain high-risk groups, Grulich said in a phone interview.
,
,New HIV infections occurred in 102 gay and bisexual men in the state of New South Wales in the first year after the study began, compared with 149 infections in the 12 months prior.
,
,""While we’ve known for at least three or four years now of individual-level efficacy of PrEP, there has been some reticence around the world by policy makers to properly fund the roll out of PrEP because the population impact hasn’t been shown -- and that’s what we set out to do,"" Grulich said.
,
,There were about 180,000 people in the US taking Truvada for PrEP at the end of June, Robin L. Washington, Gilead’s chief financial officer, said on a conference call in July.
,
,The blue, oval-shaped pill is a fixed-dose combination of the drugs tenofovir, disoproxil and emtricitabine. Generic versions of Truvada made by Mylan NV, Cipla Ltd. and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. have made the medication available more cheaply.
,
,""We see the nice steady growth of Truvada for the use of PrEP,"" Gilead’s Chief Executive Officer John F. Milligan told the Morgan Stanley Global Health Care Conference last month. Areas of the US with the highest uptake of PrEP had achieved some of the best reductions in HIV infections, he said.
,
,""I’m more confident now that the policymakers are being very innovative in thinking about how to increase access to PrEP,"" Milligan said. ""So we’ll be working on a number of things in the coming year that could really increase the number of patients on PrEP and could be very good for preventing the infection, and of course good for our business as well.""

,
,Justice C Hari Shankar reversed the trial court’s verdict awarding 10-year jail to the accused, saying it would be a ""travesty of justice"" to convict him of having committed such an “unsolved” crime. The high court, in its 69-page judgement, noted that while the child was HIV positive, accused Amardeep Kujur tested negative and noted that there were allegations that the child was sexually assaulted multiple times. It underlined that the possibility of non-transmission of the HIV virus to the accused would be remote and disagreed with the trial court’s finding that it was not necessary that the HIV virus would, in every case of sexual contact, be transmitted from partner to partner.
,
,Justice Shankar observed that the trial judge “ignored the above two facts, apparent from the evidence, i.e., firstly, that the child had suffered mucosal tears in the private parts and, secondly, that the man was alleged to have repeatedly sexually assaulted the child. Sexual contact is, it is well known, the primary mode by which HIV virus is transmitted.”
,
,In the judgement, the high court said the mystery of how the assaulter entered the room where the minor was sleeping, and sodomised him day after day, remained unanswered. “The situation, in the present case, remains a classic, and unsolved ‘locked room mystery’, even while the man stands convicted and sentenced (by the trial court). This is entirely impermissible in law,” HC noted.

,As part of the national initiative, the state government in September had launched detection survey- , and TB Intervention in Prisons and other closed settings in Tamil Nadu - for people who fall under vulnerable groups for the two diseases.
,
,The detection drive started in Trichy on November 19 and got over on December 1. A total of 1,760 people were covered in the drive including 1,195 from the Trichy central prison and special prison for women and 565 people from orphanages, rescue and rehabilitation shelters and old-age homes, that were zeroed in for the programme.
,
,Deputy director of medical services, TB control, Dr S Savithri told TOI that all people with symptoms of tuberculosis were tested during the programme. A total of 115 sputum samples were collected. “We utilised this opportunity to cover the vulnerable groups and no one tested positive for TB. Early intervention is an absolute must for efficient treatment of TB,” she said. 
,
,Though there were no new TB cases at the prisons, there were a handful of existing TB patients and they were being provided treatment. No existing TB cases were reported in other closed settings and state-run homes.
,
,While less prevalence of TB among people detected recently might seem to be positive news, according to health officials, prevalence is still high in Trichy city, Manachanallur, Thuvakudi and Thiruverumbur. So far, this year around 2,800 people were said to have received treatment for treatment in the whole district.
,
,On the other hand, all adults among the covered population were made to undergo the HIV/AIDS test. “Unlike TB, HIV/ AIDS does not show early symptoms. In some cases, it may take seven to ten years for symptoms to show. That’s why all the adults were tested,” District Aids Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU), S Martin Manivannan said. Though there were no new cases, around seven to 10 HIV/ AIDS patients were inmates at the prisons and none in the other closed settings.
,
,Manivannan said that no positive HIV/ AIDS cases was evidence for how much the disease has decreased in Trichy. “Compared to the prevalence rate of 1.91% in 2011, the prevalence is just 0.37% now. Detection drives like the recent ones show how much AIDS has been curbed in the district,” he said.

,Tho ugh the incidence of the infection in TN, which recorded 43% of all cases in the country in 2003, has come down to less than 10% this year, it has gone up from 160 in 2015-16 to 187 in 2017-18 in the 10-19 age group.

Older methods of attracting target audience such as sex workers and truckers will not work with them. While it is important to keep a tab on conventional spots, it is equally important to use social media and dating apps to spread awareness about HIV/AIDS.”
,
,While several surveys, including those carried out by the union health ministry, have recorded significant drop in awareness about HIV/AIDS in the state, funding from the Centre, state and external agencies to AIDS control society too have fallen. This year of the 69 crore outlay, 55 crore went towards salaries. “Most of our staff have been working here for more than 15 years and the salaries have substantially increased. In addition, 13 crore was given to NGOs for various programmes,” said a senior officer at TANSACS.
,
,The number of people testing positive at the voluntary testing and counselling centres have dropped to mere 30%. “This means a majority of people are being tested positive at the tertiary care centres where they go with complaints of other diseases or complications of HIV. This also means they are not diagnosed early,” said R Madhuri, a psychologist who has been working in capacity building projects with NGOs. “It means the battle against AIDS is far from over,” she said.

,The woman said she underwent clinical tests when her condition deteriorated. “The woman stated in her complaint that she did not have physical relationships with anyone other than her husband,” Mane said.

,
,Infectious disease expert Bharat Purandare said, “It is possible to transmit HIV either through an infected needle or by giving transfusion of infected blood. If the woman knows whose infected needle or blood was used to transmit the virus, a , test can be carried out on her and the HIV-affected person to establish the link.”
,
,The woman stated in her complaint after her marriage in 2015, her husband and in-laws started harassing her for money to start a business. “The woman’s father used to give in to their demands. However, the woman later refused to contact her father for more money, resulting in mental and physical harassment by the in-laws and her husband,” Mane said.
,
,The woman said her husband hatched a plot to administer her HIV-infected blood because he did not have strong grounds for a divorce. The husband and his parents have been booked under sections 498A, 323, 504 and 506 of IPC. “The husband has already filed for divorce in court,” Mane said.

"Updated: Dec 1, 2018, 23:33 IST",How this HIV-infected MP man gives hope to others,"BHOPAL: Manish Sharma, a kirana shop owner in Ujjain, tested positive for , in 2004 when his wife was pregnant. Struck by the tragedy and worried for his soon-to-be-born child, Sharma's life turned upside-down and he did not know what to do. 

,
, With a strong determination to lead a normal life, Sharma started Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) treatment with his family's support. Besides, he also set up a shelter home for HIV-positive orphaned children in his hometown Ujjain in 2014. 
,
, ""I was suffering from some health issues and was diagnosed with liver infection. I decided to go for a thorough medical check-up. The results left me in utter shock. I was more worried about my pregnant wife and the yet-to-be-born child,"" he said while sharing his ordeal with the TOI. ""My mother proved my biggest strength. I went to the National AIDS Control Organisation in Delhi for treatment where I came across a person, who was on ART treatment for last 10 years and was leading a normal life. The meeting gave me a new hope. I got my wife tested. Thankfully, she tested negative and later we also got our son tested who also tested negative. I breathed a sigh of relief and started my medicines,"" said Sharma. 
,
,Speaking about the stigma faced by HIV-positive persons, Sharma said apart from common people, some doctors too are biased against HIV+ and AIDS patients. ""I fractured my thigh in 2014, but doctors refused to perform surgery when they found out that I was HIV positive. Even pregnant HIV-positive women face difficulties as doctors refuse to perform delivery. This mentality has to be done away with,"" he said.
,
, In 2006, Sharma set up Ujjain HIV/AIDS Network People's Society where he works for the welfare of HIV-positive people. ""Many people lose hope of leading a normal life. We come together and help them start ART treatment and also provide them morale support. There is a myth that HIV-positive people cannot get married or have children. We got many HIV-positive people married and with proper treatment their children tested negative which gave them hope,"" he said. 
,
, Sharma also started working for HIV-positive children after he came across cases where such children had nowhere to go after their parents died and relatives refused to take them in. With the help of a local missionary he established a shelter home for HIV positive orphans in 2014. ""Ours is the only centre for HIV-positive kids in the state. The centre has 36 inmates and we hope many more shelters to come up in MP. The ART is provided to children by the government while the missionary provides them with food and shelter. We have come far from where we started but we still have a long way to go,"" Sharma concluded.

"Dec 1, 2018, 11:00 IST",I told my boyfriend I was HIV positive and this happened...,"I was only 22, with a head full of dreams when I landed the best journalism college in India. As cliched as it sounds. It actually felt like all my dreams were finally taking off and the dark phase had finally passed away. In addition to getting the course of choice, I was absolutely in love with my professors who were more than ready to handle my inquisitive mind. 

,
,
,It was not until I met Viraat that I realised that I won’t be able to escape the shadows of my past any longer. He was a nice guy with a good heart and he made me laugh. Our conversations soon progressed from chai breaks during lectures to late night calls. We both knew that we were inching towards a proper relationship, but before it was too late to turn back, I had to tell him the truth about myself. 
,
,
,The same truth I had kept to myself for so long with no intentions to ever bring up again. But here he was and if anything, he deserved the truth. 
,
,
,I was 19 when I started feeling feverish and exhausted all the time. We ran many tests but everything was ruled out. Soon enough, I started feeling severe swelling and pain in my lymph nodes, especially the back of my neck. My body started aching and it started to hurt a lot everywhere. Completely clueless, the doctors kept giving me painkillers and antibiotics
,
,
,After three weeks, I met a doctor that informed me that I had contracted the human immunodeficiency virus or HIV. I stood rooted to the ground, while he tried to comfort me saying he would prescribe me some medicines which will help in suppressing the virus.
,
,
,I was devastated to put it simply. I thought being diagnosed with HIV meant that my life was over and I had AIDS. The doctor told me that AIDS was the most serious complication of HIV diseases.
,
,
,The bottom line was HIV was incurable and if left untreated it could go on reducing my T cells. The same cells which fight infection, hence rendering me helpless
,
,
,Strangely, the first person I thought about was Viraat. I had to tell him about everything before things went any further. So, mustering up all the courage in the world, I took a deep breath and said, “Viraat, ,.” In all honesty, I did know how I was expecting him to react. The silence felt like ages and he finally spoke, “I have a lot of questions.” 
,
,
,He took a long pause and asked me a lot of questions, the primary one being how well I was taking care of myself and what should he be doing to make my life easier. His genuine concern and warmth seeped through his words. He did not judge me or asked me any questions like where did I contract it from. He was patient and calm and it was pretty much the best reaction I had ever gotten from anyone. 
,
,
,Fast-forward 5 years later, Viraat and I are happily married! Obviously, we go for regular check-ups and I have asked my doctor what all can be done to prevent Viraat from getting that virus, apart from protection. The doctor asked him to take a Pre-exposure prophylaxis (or PrEP) pill. It is a pill for the people who are at a very high risk of contracting HIV. 
,
,
,As for the good news, the risk of getting HIV from intercourse might be even lower if you combine PrEP with condoms and other prevention methods.
