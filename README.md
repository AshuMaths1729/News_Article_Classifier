# News Article Classifier
News Article classification from raw unlabeled scraped data

To make scraper, first install Scrapy on your system, then make a Crawler named TOI, and scraper named toi, then replace the scraper in spyder folder with toi.py.

The main problem with this project was that the data collected was not labeled, that is it did not had labels for classes. So, I clustered the data into 5 classes after preprocessing it, and then made different analysis on it.

The results are as follows
